252;MS_64a;Greta's hand is probably longer than Andre's hand.;MS.64a.153.1;1
253;MS_64a;Because Greta's hands are small. And Andre's hands are big.;MS.64a.315.1;1
254;MS_64a;Because they are older than the other and their hand have different hands, or one of them opened their finger and the other did not.;MS.64a.459.1;1
255;MS_64a;I think different hands size.;MS.64a.535.1;1
256;MS_43a;Because Jin's group has less marbles and Bee's group had more marbles.;MS.43a.293.1;0
257;MS_43a;I think you put 34 marbles to put the same sizes.;MS.43a.435.1;0

271;MS_50a;Celsius.;MS.50a.499.1;1
272;MS_14b;Because 10 grams plus 20 grams is 30 grams.;MS.14b.116.1;0
273;MS_14b;I chose that answer because left side is heavy than the right side I think that is the answer.;MS.14b.294.1;0

275;MS_14b;Because it is not 30 because they already show you so it must be 40.;MS.14b.571.1;1

278;MS_30b;That they have different hands that are big and small.;MS.30b.382.1;0
279;MS_30b;They could use a tape meter so they could measure both the rug and the floor.;MS.30b.566.1;1
280;MX_1;I think it is because the salt was small enough and the sand was too big for it. The salt had gone away dissolved. Sand particles was too big.;MX.1.532.1;0
281;MX_1;Because the salt fit through the holes in the filter.;MX.1.629.1;1
282;MX_1;The salt is a smaller grain. The sand is more chunky and thicker so it not easy for it to go through.;MX.1.638.1;0
283;MX_1;Because the salt was a smaller particle than the sand.;MX.1.639.1;1
284;MX_22a;Because a solution is something you use in a everyday life, and mixture is something we do not always use.;MX.22a.433.1;0
285;MX_22a;A solution is a mixture that cannot be taken apart.;MX.22a.467.1;0
286;MX_22a;Different items.;MX.22a.541.1;0
287;MX_22a;A mixture is 2 thing put together, a solution is one thing that disperses into the so that the first material cannot be seen.;MX.22a.565.1;0
288;MX_24;Because you can see through it, and the mixture will dissolve into it.;MX.24.418.1;1
289;MX_24;You can not see the solid no more because it is going and you cannot see the solution.;MX.24.468.1;0
290;MX_24;You know when the solid cannot be seen.;MX.24.527.1;0
291;MX_24;When the solid dissolves into the liquid.;MX.24.566.1;0
292;MX_52b;The crystals are the same shape and they look the same.;MX.52b.397.1;0
293;MX_52b;Because in the key, alum is the exact same pattern as the one above.;MX.52b.425.1;1
294;MX_52b;I think that the Epsom salt because it look like salt crystal. It is sodium hyposulfite or alum.;MX.52b.459.1;0
295;MX_52b;Because below the alum picture looks just like the one above.;MX.52b.607.1;1
296;MX_42a;Because the solid is big and it cannot go through the filter paper.;MX.42a.416.1;1
297;MX_42a;The solid stays because it is bigger than the holes in filter and stay in the filter.;MX.42a.460.1;1
298;MX_42a;The solid is bigger than the holes in the filter.;MX.42a.500.1;1
299;MX_42a;Because you cannot handle the water. For example we cannot handle water on our hands but we can handle solid things.;MX.42a.601.1;0
300;MX_16a;No because Mariella's is more concentrated because her's has less water so it is taste more sweeter or saltier.;MX.16a.436.1;0
301;MX_16a;Yes because they both have the same amount of water.;MX.16a.492.1;0
302;MX_16a;Yes, because if the same amount of solute and make a saturated solution the concentration would be the same if the solutions had the same volume.;MX.16a.497.1;0
303;MX_16a;No because one has 100 milliliters of water and the other has 250 milliliters of water.;MX.16a.636.1;0
304;MX_46b;Because they are equally concentrated and they both have some of water.;MX.46b.385.1;0
305;MX_46b;There is 2 times as much of the same solution in B as in A therefore equal volumes would weigh the same.;MX.46b.399.1;1
306;MX_46b;Taking 50 milliliters from solution B would equal solution A.;MX.46b.455.1;0
307;MX_46b;Solution B is just double solution A.;MX.46b.525.1;0
308;MX_47b;Cup 2 has more material on the bottom than cup one. So cup one might one scoop saturated and cup 2 might have 3 scoops on the bottom but the same concentration in the solution.;MX.47b.456.1;1
309;MX_47b;Because cup A have more solute then cup one. But they have the same amount of water.;MX.47b.493.1;0
310;MX_47b;I chose C because it has 8 spoons solute.;MX.47b.528.1;0
311;MX_47b;Once saturated it is at the most concentration it can get, and they are both saturated.;MX.47b.575.1;1
312;MX_10;Because it was bubbly.;MX.10.389.1;0
313;MX_10;Because it bubbled.;MX.10.431.1;0
314;MX_10;Jorge knew that because it was bubbly and when it bubbly it means it is gas.;MX.10.564.1;1
315;MX_10;Because once the 2 chemicals mixed the solution started to react by fizzing bubble.;MX.10.574.1;1
316;MX_18;That indicates that there is a precipitate on the sides.;MX.18.176.1;0
317;MX_18;It is a reaction.;MX.18.429.1;1
318;MX_18;That indicates the 2 thing mixed together became a precipitate.;MX.18.557.1;0
319;MX_18;There was a chemical reaction and a precipitate was formed.;MX.18.575.1;1
320;MX_19;A gas is being formed causing it to bubble.;MX.19.381.1;0
321;MX_19;Fizzing usually means bubbles. And bubbles mean there was gas formed which is a sign of a chemical reaction so yes.;MX.19.396.1;1
322;MX_19;The bubbles occurred because it was gas.;MX.19.504.1;0
323;MX_19;Probably.;MX.19.540.1;0
324;MX_36a;She make a solution because she put eggshells into the cup and covered.;MX.36a.126.1;0
325;MX_36a;Because when she found it was.;MX.36a.176.1;0
326;MX_36a;She made a solution because she did eggshells and vinegar. Vinegar makes stuff bubble.;MX.36a.572b.1;0
327;MX_36a;Because something dissolved and stuff.;MX.36a.608.1;0
328;MX_36b;The bubbles.;MX.36b.172.1;1
329;MX_36b;Because of the bubbles on the shell.;MX.36b.455.1;1
330;MX_36b;Because the vinegar is a reaction to eggshells and because of the reaction the eggshells are gone.;MX.36b.498.1;0
331;MX_36b;Because she added more than 2 chemicals producing the small bubbles on the eggshells that dissolved.;MX.36b.637.1;1
332;MX_41;Yes because solubility means how soluble a mixture is. So they can be more or less soluble.;MX.41.390.1;1
333;MX_41;Yes.;MX.41.462.1;0
334;MX_41;No because all different solids have different solubility.;MX.41.466.1;0
335;MX_41;They could be different because they are not the same thing.;MX.41.635.1;1
336;MX_11a;That it is clear that is how he can know.;MX.11a.392.1;1
337;MX_11a;Mixture one and 3 are both clear and nothing on bottom.;MX.11a.464.1;1
338;MX_11a;Mixture one and 2 are clear.;MX.11a.500.1;1
339;MX_11a;The mixture 4 and 5 are saturated and a mixture is not a solution until it is saturated.;MX.11a.641.1;0
340;MX_11c;Mixture 5 is greater than mixture 4, it had more solid.;MX.11c.304.1;0
341;MX_11c;The same because they are saturation and it cannot go any more.;MX.11c.385.1;1
342;MX_11c;Same because they both got something.;MX.11c.532.1;0
343;MX_11c;More because there is more solid.;MX.11c.592.1;0
344;MX_11e;You use a filter to separate the solid and the water in a cup the solid stays on the filter and the water goes through.;MX.11e.304.1;0
345;MX_11e;He could evaporate the water and then the solid will turn into crystals.;MX.11e.559.1;1
346;MX_11e;He could put the solution through filter paper and separated the solute and the solvent.;MX.11e.571.1;0
347;MX_11e;Filter the solution and the salt, dissolved salt, will stay on the filter and the water will just go back in the cup.;MX.11e.637.1;0
348;MX_11f;Clear with nothing on the bottom because one is clear with nothing on the bottom and 3 is the same.;MX.11f.393.1;1
349;MX_11f;He would observe nothing. It would be a solution. Because mixture one and 3 each have one scoop more or less and they are still solutions.;MX.11f.425.1;0
350;MX_11f;It would probably saturate.;MX.11f.429.1;0
351;MX_11f;Clear nothing on bottom because mixture 3 has clear and nothing on the bottom and it has 3 scoops.;MX.11f.560.1;1
352;MX_49;X, cup x is a lot more concentrated because x is more heavy.;MX.49.385.1;1
353;MX_49;Y, I think y because x just because it is heavier does not mean that that is more concentrated. I think it means it is less concentrated because there is more room the more water the more room.;MX.49.392.1;0
354;MX_49;X, because solution x weighs more and has more solute.;MX.49.467.1;1
355;MX_49;X, because cup x has more stuff in it than cup y. cup y could still hold more.;MX.49.488.1;0
356;MX_53;Yes, because he could find out what type of crystals they are.;MX.53.425.1;0
357;MX_53;By comparing them to other solutions.;MX.53.473.1;0
358;MX_53;Weight them all.;MX.53.528.1;0
359;MX_53;Each crystal has its own properties so if he recognized if he would know what solute it was.;MX.53.575.1;1

363;PS_2a;A rubber band make a sound by vibration when you pluck it, so that is how it cause the sound.;PS.2a.605.1;1
364;PS_45b;Sammy's idea - Because the plastic, the metal, and the wood are different sounds.;PS.45b.179.1;1
365;PS_45b;Sammy - Because Nathaniel's is the same material and Sammy's is different material than just wood.;PS.45b.334.1;1
366;PS_45b;Nathaniel - Because it has different sounds and metal vibrates more than wood and plastics, plastic is a different material than wood and makes a different sound.;PS.45b.457.1;0

431;SE_22b;That blue absorbs heat faster than the red.;SE.22b.565.1;1

458;SE_46;Yes. Yes because black absorbs the heat more than white.;SE.46.603.1;1
459;SE_46;Yes. Yes, because black absorbs heat from the sun.;SE.46.605.1;1

585;EV_12b;10 to 15, Well, if you go past 15 that will be too much and if you go below 10 that will be too little so it is just right. So it will be around 12, 13, 14, or 15.;EV.12b.420.1;0
586;EV_12b;10 to 20, I decided that because those are the numbers that had long roots.;EV.12b.421.1;1
587;EV_12b;10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, those were the plants with roots.;EV.12b.428.1;1
588;EV_12b;20 milliliters, Range mean biggest number and lowest number subtracted by.;EV.12b.429.1;0

590;EV_12b;20 milliliters, Because after 20 milliliters the seeds roots were 0 centimeters.;EV.12b.431.1;0
591;EV_12b;20 milliliters, To find the range you have got to take the lowest amount of water and subtract that from the highest amount of water.

626;EV_12b;33 milliliters, Because all together it is 33, 25 plus 8 equals 33.;EV.12b.545.1;0
627;EV_12b;10 milliliters to 20 milliliters of water. On the root graph pot 2, 3 and 4 were the only ones that had root so I looked at the other graph and looked at the same pot number and then looked at the water amount.;EV.12b.547.1;1

711;EV_22a;No, Because it seems that he got a mix up for the plants on the water.;EV.22a.437.1;0
712;EV_22a;Yes, I think he did a good job because he tested the same plant in different pots and put different amounts of water and food. It was good that he tested 2 because if he only had one he would not have anything to compare it with and find if it is good or not.;EV.22a.443.1;0
713;EV_22a;Yes, Yes because he used different amounts of water and food. He also used the same type of soil in both pots.;EV.22a.444.1;0

954;EV_11;Optimum condition is best condition. Range of tolerance is preferred condition.;EV.11.211.1;1
955;EV_11;A range of tolerance means what is the highest amount it can handle and what is the lowest amount it can handle. An optimum condition is the best amount of something.;EV.11.222.1;1
956;EV_11;They both mean where they live with that environmental factor.;EV.11.227.1;0
957;EV_11;Opposite, because range of tolerance means most likely to die, optimum means best condition. The best condition is the one that is preferred like the brine shrimp. Optimum condition is preferred. Range of tolerance is when it is going to die, not in right optimum condition.;EV.11.227172.1;0
958;EV_11;Range of tolerance and optimum are both about environments, but range of tolerance is what environment can they stay in without dying and optimum is the one they like the best.;EV.11.227180.1;1

973;EV_11;They both have places where an organism can live and stay.;EV.11.320.1;0
974;EV_11;The relationship of range of tolerance and its optimum condition is which organism can stand the best and which organism grows the best.;EV.11.322.1;1

977;EV_11;I think the relationship is that they both have something to do with how much something grows.;EV.11.386.1;0
978;EV_11;With the organisms range of tolerance, it tells about the growth and its optimum condition is.;EV.11.389.1;0

987;EV_11;They both tell what an organism needs.;EV.11.463.1;0

1042;EV_25;It might die because it is only found in saltwater but it might stay alive because it is still water.;EV.25.384.1;0

1138;EV_35a;No, Because was not controlling the environment.;EV.35a.261.1;0
1139;EV_35a;No, because they might lay more egg than the others but maybe they just need a longer time with them.;EV.35a.263.1;0
1140;EV_35a;Yes, because the variable helps you see the conditions of the chicken and helps you see the difference.;EV.35a.381.1;0
1141;EV_35a;Yes because he did different things to one group than the other also it was over a long period of time.;EV.35a.383.1;0

1168;EV_35a;No, No, because in group x he did not supply enough food and calcium as he did for group y.;EV.35a.463.1;0
1169;EV_35a;Yes, Andrew did a good job he made sure the chickens had almost the same amount, it was also good because he had over a 100 eggs laid.;EV.35a.464.1;0
1170;EV_35a;Yes, He made the daily care different to see what their optimum condition.;EV.35a.465.1;0
1171;EV_35a;No, He needs to take more notes.;EV.35a.466.1;0
1172;EV_35a;Yes, Yes because, he did not add factors he did not need and he did not change his.;EV.35a.469.1;0
1173;EV_35a;Yes, Yes, because he did correct info and he had good variables.;EV.35a.472.1;0
1174;EV_35a;No, He did not do a good job of controlling the variables, because now you do not know what caused different results.;EV.35a.474.1;1
1175;EV_35a;No, He had too many variables.;EV.35a.475.1;0
1176;EV_35a;No, He should of recorded for each chicken separately.;EV.35a.476.1;0
1177;EV_35a;No, he should record data for each chicken.;EV.35a.487.1;0
1178;EV_35a;No, because he should have had a different number of tests with the grams section.;EV.35a.488.1;0
1179;EV_35a;Yes, because he made the chicken laid eggs after 2 weeks.;EV.35a.494.1;0
1180;EV_35a;Yes, because now he knows that more feed and more calcium for every 10 chickens produces more eggs.;EV.35a.503.1;0
1181;EV_35a;Yes, yes because he did not go off the charts in daily care.;EV.35a.504.1;0
1182;EV_35a;Yes, everything should have been the same besides one thing the thing he is testing.;EV.35a.507.1;0
1183;EV_35a;No, On the calcium for group section he should have made them even like 10 and 30 grams, or else he did excellent.;EV.35a.509.1;0
1184;EV_35a;Yes, yes because he did great in his experiment.;EV.35a.510.1;0
1185;EV_35a;Yes, because he used one variable.;EV.35a.525.1;0
1186;EV_35a;No, because you can get information of how much eggs they lay and the food for each group. Also the calcium for the chickens.;EV.35a.527.1;0
1187;EV_35a;Yes, because the only thing changed was the chicken feed.;EV.35a.529.1;0
1188;EV_35a;Yes, I think yes because it was well controlled and well organized. But he could have done better.;EV.35a.531.1;0
1189;EV_35a;Yes, Yes because he put the number of chicken it was low.;EV.35a.532.1;0
1190;EV_35a;No, because he did not control the variable.;EV.35a.534.1;0
1191;EV_35a;Yes, Yes because Andrew fed the chickens a good amount so the chickens laid there eggs.;EV.35a.536.1;0
1192;EV_35a;No, No, because the chickens got fed different amount and different amounts of calcium.;EV.35a.537.1;0
1193;EV_35a;No, Because he recorded more than one variable daily care and egg production.;EV.35a.538.1;0
1194;EV_35a;Yes, be the number of eggs laid by group y is a lot more than the eggs laid by group x.;EV.35a.544.1;0
1195;EV_35a;No, no because after listing the same amount of chickens it cost different amounts?;EV.35a.545.1;0
1196;EV_35a;Because he put too many chickens in one group and would not know which one laid eggs.;EV.35a.546.1;0
1197;EV_35a;No, No because he is not controlling anything but the numbers of chicken.;EV.35a.626.1;0
1198;EV_35a;No, because the should have put have look like every day.;EV.35a.636.1;0
1199;EV_35a;Yes, because he writes how much chickens, how much he fed the chickens, how much calcium they got, even how much eggs they laid.;EV.35a.638.1;0
1200;EV_35a;No, because he changed 2 things instead of one so he does not know which one works.;EV.35a.639.1;1
1201;EV_35a;No, Because there were 2 things that were different in the experiment. The food and the calcium. So he will not know which one of those affected it.;EV.35a.645.1;1
1202;EV_35a;No, Andrew should have given group x more calcium because 5 grams of calcium is not enough.;EV.35a.647.1;0

2049;HB_43;It takes less time to get a response to your hand than your foot.;HB.43.327.1;0
2050;HB_43;The reason is because your hand is closer to your brain.;HB.43.329.1;0
2051;HB_43;It takes longer time for the brain to send a message to the foot and back than it takes for the hand because it is closer to your brain the nerves travel a smaller distance.;HB.43.330.1;1
2052;HB_43;Why Corey is that your feet have more muscle than your hand.;HB.43.331.1;0
2053;HB_43;Corey's right hand is faster than his right foot because his hand is closer to his brain than his foot so it is easier for the right hand.;HB.43.348.1;0
2054;HB_43;The reason Corey's right hand is closer than his right foot is because your right hand is closer to your brain and your left foot is farther.;HB.43.351.1;0
2055;HB_43;The lower body supports our upper body. So it is heavier.;HB.43.365.1;0
2056;HB_43;Your right hand would be faster than your right foot because your hand is more closer to your brain than you foot is.;HB.43.383.1;0
2057;HB_43;The right hand is faster because it is closer to the brain and the foot is not.;HB.43.386.1;0
2058;HB_43;The right hand is closer to the brain.;HB.43.387.1;0
2059;HB_43;Your right hand is faster because it is already on the brake.;HB.43.390.1;0
2060;HB_43;The right hand is faster than the right foot because his hand is closer to his brain.;HB.43.391.1;0
2061;HB_43;Corey your right hand has more practice than your right foot.;HB.43.393.1;0
2062;HB_43;From what I know his right hand was faster than his right foot is because of your coordination and some can have hand-eye coordination.;HB.43.422.1;0
2063;HB_43;The right hand is closer to your head so the brain can get the message to your hand faster. Also, people usually use their hands more.;HB.43.423.1;1
2064;HB_43;His right hand is faster because his hands are stronger.;HB.43.425.1;0
2065;HB_43;Maybe his muscles are very heavy to keep Corey from moving his feet fast enough.;HB.43.427.1;0
2066;HB_43;His right hand is faster than his right foot because it is less distance for a hand than a foot.;HB.43.428.1;0
2067;HB_43;It was probably easier to move his hand because he probably uses his hand move than his foot.;HB.43.429.1;0
2068;HB_43;When you try moving your foot fast it bounces your leg around and slows it down but your arm does not.;HB.43.432.1;0
2069;HB_43;The right hand is faster because you move the fingers around more than toes so your hand will be faster.;HB.43.435.1;0
2070;HB_43;Your right hand is use to doing that kind of fast movement. That is why it is faster.;HB.43.437.1;0
2071;HB_43;Your right hand is faster than your right foot because you use it more.;HB.43.439.1;0
2072;HB_43;His foot may be a little bit harder. So his right hand is able to go a lot faster.;HB.43.471.1;0
2073;HB_43;Because his foot is down low so it took longer to get to it and his is closer so it could move faster.;HB.43.490.1;1
2074;HB_43;Because when you send the message to your hand or foot it travels to your hand faster than traveling to your foot so you can move your hand faster.;HB.43.494.1;0
2075;HB_43;Because the message goes down your spine and then the message goes down your shoulder.;HB.43.495.1;0
2076;HB_43;His right hand was faster than his right foot because the message coming from his brain and down his spinal cord took longer. Because his leg or foot is lower down.;HB.43.502.1;1
2077;HB_43;Your hand is closer to your brain and less distance for your nerves.;HB.43.504.1;1
2078;HB_43;His foot does not work as well because your right hand or left you use that hand for writing.;HB.43.525.1;0
2079;HB_43;Your right hand is better than your right foot is because you do more stuff with your right hand.;HB.43.528.1;0
2080;HB_43;The reason why is your brain takes longer to send a message.;HB.43.561.1;0
2081;HB_43;How Corey's hand moved faster than his foot is the brain has easier makes to your hand than your foot!;HB.43.563.1;0
2082;HB_43;It is because your brain can send messages to your hand faster than your feet so that is why your hand get 5 miss and that is why.;HB.43.564.1;0
2083;HB_43;Because his hand is closer to his brain.;HB.43.566.1;0
2084;HB_43;I think his hand is faster because his brain can send a message to his hand faster than his brain can send a message to his foot.;HB.43.572.1;0
2085;HB_43;Corey right hand went faster than his right foot because the brain sends messages to your hand quicker than his foot. His hand is closer.;HB.43.575.1;1
2086;HB_43;The reason Corey could not move his foot as fast as his hand is because, the foot is farther away from the brain.;HB.43.576.1;0
2087;HB_43;The hand is closer to the brain than the foot so your brain can send messages faster to the hand than foot.;HB.43.577.1;1

2089;HB_43;Corey's right hand is faster.;HB.43.594.1;0
2090;HB_43;It takes a longer time for your brain to tell your feet to move.;HB.43.595.1;0
2091;HB_43;The hand is faster because your hands are closer to your brain than are feet you can see our.;HB.43.598.1;0
2092;HB_43;His right hand is faster because it is closer to the brain and the message goes faster in the hand because it is closer and it takes longer for the message to reach the bottom.;HB.43.600.1;1
2093;HB_43;His right hand is faster because it is a short distance to the brain.;HB.43.603.1;0
2094;HB_43;It would be easier for Corey to move his hands because it is slightly faster to get a message to your hand than it is for your feet.;HB.43.604.1;0
2095;HB_43;His right hand is faster because the brain sends a message to the hand and from the brain to his right hand it is shorter to get there and it is longer for the message to get to his right foot.;HB.43.610.1;1
2096;HB_43;His hand moved fast because your hand is closer. So that means that the stimulus will get there faster.;HB.43.629.1;1
2097;HB_43;You should practice mover because you could get faster at it.;HB.43.640.1;0
2098;HB_43;His right hand was faster because he probably uses his hands more than feet.;HB.43.641.1;0
2099;HB_43;One reason is that you get faster response time with your hand because it is closer to your brain.;HB.43.649.1;1
2100;HB_43;Dear Cory the reason why your right hand is faster than your right foot is because your right hand gets more practice than your right foot.;HB.43.650.1;0
2101;HB_43;Because it is the bone that you can move faster.;HB.43.981.1;0

3663;WA_21;Because 0 degrees Celsius is the freezing point of water. When water freezes it expands. The water bottle cracked because the ice needed more room than the water.;WA.21.497.1;1
3664;WA_21;Because, when water freezes it expands.;WA.21.504.1;1
3665;WA_21;The water froze and expanded and pushed on the side until it cracked.;WA.21.505.1;1
3666;WA_21;0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees Fahrenheit and it is 32 degrees Fahrenheit the water froze and when water freezes the ice expands.;WA.21.510.1;0
3667;WA_21;Because if you leave a cup or bottle of water outside when it is 0 degrees Celsius it will crack.;WA.21.521.1;0
3668;WA_21;The bottle get so cold and froze that it cracked the plastic bottle.;WA.21.522.1;0
3669;WA_21;Because the water in the water bottle froze and it expanded and it did not have enough room, so it cracked.;WA.21.523.1;1
3670;WA_21;Because at 0 degrees Celsius water freezes, when water freezes, it expands or gets bigger, in this case too big for the container causing it to crack.;WA.21.526.1;1
3671;WA_21;Because when water drops below 0 the water expands. So the water expanded so much it made the water bottle crack.;WA.21.527.1;1
3672;WA_21;It cracked because the bottle was full and just like if you leave a pop can in the freezer too long it will burst.;WA.21.528.1;0
3673;WA_21;It cracked because solid ice expands. It got so cold the water turned to ice so the bottle cracked.;WA.21.529.1;1
3674;WA_21;Because it was so cold it cracked.;WA.21.533.1;0
3675;WA_21;The bottle cracked because water expands when it hits the freezing point.;WA.21.534.1;1
3676;WA_21;Because when the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius, water freezes and expands the water in the water bottle froze and expanded. When the water bottle could not hold it any more, it cracked.;WA.21.536.1;1
3677;WA_21;It was cold outside.;WA.21.539.1;0
3678;WA_21;When water is frozen it expands and that is why the water bottle cracked. PS. It has happened to my dad.;WA.21.541.1;1
3679;WA_21;The bottle cracked because of how cold the water was cold water cracks plastic.;WA.21.542.1;0
3680;WA_21;Because the water turned to ice and the ice need space to get cold that night.;WA.21.558.1;0
3681;WA_21;Because when the bottle is full and the temperature drops. The water expands.;WA.21.560.1;0
3682;WA_21;Because the bottle stays in there a long time.;WA.21.564.1;0
3683;WA_21;Because it froze inside the car and then it did not have much air to use so it cracked.;WA.21.566.1;0
3684;WA_21;Because when the temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit water will freeze. And when water freezes it expands. That is why the bottle cracked.;WA.21.567.1;1
3685;WA_21;Because it is really really really hot in cars and cars are hot.;WA.21.572.1;0
3686;WA_21;Because the water probably froze and frozen ice expands.;WA.21.573.1;1
3687;WA_21;The ice expanded because it.;WA.21.577.1;0
3688;WA_21;First it was the water bottle and then since it was so cold it froze and cracked. Because it was cold.;WA.21.591.1;0
3689;WA_21;Because when water burns into ice it bulges and creates more volume.;WA.21.593.1;1
3690;WA_21;When the temperature is cold 0 degrees Celsius the bottle is cold.;WA.21.595.1;0
3691;WA_21;Because it was getting so cold that it cracked.;WA.21.599.1;0
3692;WA_21;Because it turned into ice and ice expands.;WA.21.600.1;0
3693;WA_21;Because it got below the freezing point and it froze and it expanded and the bottle broke open.;WA.21.603.1;1
3694;WA_21;When water freezes it expands.;WA.21.604.1;0
3695;WA_21;The water bottle cracked because the water in the cup got frozen and expanded which broke the cup.;WA.21.605.1;1
3696;WA_21;Because it get too cold.;WA.21.607.1;0
3697;WA_21;Because the trunk is 0 degrees Celsius in there so it broke the bottle.;WA.21.608.1;0
3698;WA_21;Too much pressure.;WA.21.630.1;0
3699;WA_21;Because the water turned into ice and all the atoms spread out and broke the bottle.;WA.21.631.1;1
3700;WA_21;The water freezes and the ice's molecules spread and made it crack.;WA.21.637.1;1
3701;WA_21;It froze and it was less dense because it need more space so it needed to break because it did not have no more space to go.;WA.21.640.1;1
3702;WA_21;The bottle cracked because when it freeze it expands too. So the bottle was getting pushed so it popped and cracked.;WA.21.642.1;1
3703;WA_21;Because maybe it was too cold and the water contract which make the water was too cold and crack.;WA.21.643.1;0
3704;WA_50b;My evidence is the picture. When an object is denser than water, it shrinks. The picture showed that the marble sinks, so the marble is denser than the water.;WA.50b.172.1;1
3705;WA_50b;When something is more dense than water it will sink which is what the marble did.;WA.50b.175.1;1
3706;WA_50b;Because it is a solid hard rock. But if it was ice it would not sink it would float.;WA.50b.177.1;1
3707;WA_50b;The marble is denser so the denser it is the more it sinks.;WA.50b.180.1;1
3708;WA_50b;When the red, hot water in a little cup, the water that is red goes to the bottom of the cup. When it is a little cup of blue, cold water that water stays at the top.;WA.50b.185.1;0

3711;WA_50b;The marble is denser than the water that is why it sank.;WA.50b.191.1;1
3712;WA_50b;My evidence is that the marble sunk.;WA.50b.193.1;1
3713;WA_50b;Because a marble is heavy so it will go down.;WA.50b.194.1;1
3714;WA_50b;The marble breaks through the water surface.;WA.50b.195.1;1
3715;WA_50b;The marble sank.;WA.50b.206.1;1
3716;WA_50b;The marble is denser than the water because it has air bubbles.;WA.50b.207.1;0

3718;WA_50b;The marble sunk.;WA.50b.209.1;1
3719;WA_50b;Well, it sank so that means it is more dense than the water.;WA.50b.210.1;1
3720;WA_50b;The marble sinks when it is more dense.;WA.50b.211.1;1
3721;WA_50b;If the marble was less dense it would float.;WA.50b.212.1;1
3722;WA_50b;Because it was denser, so it sank.;WA.50b.213.1;1
3723;WA_50b;My evidence is that the marble is more compact than the water.;WA.50b.214.1;0
3724;WA_50b;When we dropped a wooden ball in a cup with water we discovered it was less dense.;WA.50b.215.1;0

3730;WA_50b;It went to the bottom of the cup.;WA.50b.230.1;1
3731;WA_50b;My evidence is that when an object sinks it means that it is not very compact.;WA.50b.231.1;1
3732;WA_50b;My evidence is the marble was more dense than the water so it sunk.;WA.50b.247.1;1

3780;WA_50b;Because it sinks, it goes down, it is denser.;WA.50b.526.1;1
3781;WA_50b;Well if the marble was less dense or the same density the marble would not have sank.;WA.50b.527.1;1
3782;WA_50b;Just like ice when something is denser than water it will sink.;WA.50b.528.1;1

3797;WA_50b;No answer.;WA.50b.611.1;0
3798;WA_50b;The marble is more dense because it went down if it was less dense it will be floating on top of the water.;WA.50b.612.1;1
3799;WA_50b;It sank. If it was less dense it would float.;WA.50b.630.1;1

3803;WA_50b;Because the marble sink so it is denser.;WA.50b.642.1;1
3804;WA_18;I disagree with you Angie. Yes that could happen but it is not always like that. Evaporation also could happen at any surface temperature.;WA.18.173.1;1
3805;WA_18;I disagree because evaporation happens everywhere just slower in colder places.;WA.18.175.1;1
3806;WA_18;No because water does not have to heated to a high temperature to evaporate, it would still evaporate if it was cold outside.;WA.18.177.1;1
3807;WA_18;I agree because the only way water evaporates.;WA.18.178.1;0
3808;WA_18;I do not agree. It does not matter if the water is heated or not because the sun will shine and it will still evaporate.;WA.18.180.1;1
3809;WA_18;I disagree because it would only evaporate faster it can be in a room and evaporate but it would take longer.;WA.18.183.1;1
3810;WA_18;I agree because I remember when the class put cups by the sun and it evaporated faster than all of the other cups we had around the room.;WA.18.184.1;0
3811;WA_18;I agree because water does heated by the sun that evaporates so yes I agree.;WA.18.197.1;0
3812;WA_18;I disagree because when we did our experiment the water in the jug evaporated, but not as fast.;WA.18.206.1;1
3813;WA_18;I disagree because it does not only happen when water is heated.;WA.18.208.1;1
3814;WA_18;I disagree because if it is hot out it will evaporate. But it still will evaporate if it is cool out. It just evaporates slower.;WA.18.209.1;1
3815;WA_18;No, I do not agree, because water can evaporate when it is cold, it just goes slower.;WA.18.214.1;1
3816;WA_18;I agree. Because cold water can it just takes longer.;WA.18.216.1;0
3817;WA_18;I disagree Evaporation happens when it is cold and hot because of the air.;WA.18.220.1;1
3818;WA_18;I agree.;WA.18.222.1;0
3819;WA_18;I disagree because the water cycle never stops, even in cold places.;WA.18.223.1;1
3820;WA_18;I disagree because evaporation happen when it is cold too.;WA.18.224.1;1
3821;WA_18;I disagree with Angie because evaporation happens with cold water but it evaporates slower.;WA.18.226.1;1
3822;WA_18;I disagree because evaporation happens in cool areas, just slower.;WA.18.227.1;1
3823;WA_18;I disagree because evaporation can happen. When it is cold, too. Once, I left a cup of water out on a cold night, and the next morning it was gone.;WA.18.231.1;1
3824;WA_18;I disagree, evaporation happens everywhere, even on cold days. It just takes longer when it is cool out.;WA.18.244.1;1
3825;WA_18;I disagree because you can have a cold class of water sitting outside on a hot day and the water would evaporate.;WA.18.245.1;1
3826;WA_18;I disagree because we tried evaporation with slightly cold water and it worked.;WA.18.246.1;1
3827;WA_18;I disagree because when water is heated to a high temperature it does not evaporate quickly.;WA.18.249.1;0
3828;WA_18;I disagree because it does evaporate in high temperatures but it just takes a little longer in cold air.;WA.18.250.1;1
3829;WA_18;I disagree because the water only evaporation works on cold areas.;WA.18.251.1;0
3830;WA_18;I disagree with Angie because evaporation can happen in the rain too.;WA.18.252.1;0
3831;WA_18;I agree because when you take a warm shower it is all steamy and after that it evaporates on the glass.;WA.18.253.1;0
3832;WA_18;I agree because it is true water does evaporate if you will put it on heated high.;WA.18.254.1;0
3833;WA_18;I disagree because, evaporation has happened in my cold water before.;WA.18.260.1;1
3834;WA_18;I disagree because if you put a cup of water and put it in a fridge it will still evaporate.;WA.18.261.1;1
3835;WA_18;Agree.;WA.18.265.1;0
3836;WA_18;I agree because water evaporates because it is too hot.;WA.18.266.1;0
3837;WA_18;I agree because it says on our chart more water evaporates when heated.;WA.18.276.1;0
3838;WA_18;I disagree because last year we put room temperature water in a cup and we put the cups outside when it was cold the water evaporated.;WA.18.296.1;1
3839;WA_18;I disagree because in my class, evaporation can happen if cold too.;WA.18.297.1;1
3840;WA_18;I agree. Because water evaporates it warms up. The water goes in the air and stays there until it hits something cool and solid.;WA.18.301.1;0
3841;WA_18;I disagree because water can evaporate in the cold too, but when it is not it just evaporates faster.;WA.18.346.1;1
3842;WA_18;If evaporation when it hot and cold mostly when it hot.;WA.18.349.1;0
3843;WA_18;Because it can happen to anyone.;WA.18.350.1;0
3844;WA_18;Because heat absorbs the water.;WA.18.351.1;0
3845;WA_18;Because it has to evaporate into the clouds and when the clouds get too much water, it rains, and the word for that is condensation.;WA.18.354.1;0
3846;WA_18;I agree with both because evaporation only happens when water is hot or cold.;WA.18.355.1;0
3847;WA_18;I disagree because evaporation means it went up in the air or we all could die.;WA.18.356.1;0
3848;WA_18;I disagree with Angie because it can still be cold.;WA.18.358.1;1
3849;WA_18;I disagree because water does not only evaporate when it is at a high temperature it only evaporates quicker.;WA.18.361.1;1
3850;WA_18;Agree because when condensation happens the water warms up and it evaporation happens.;WA.18.363.1;0
3851;WA_18;I disagree because evaporation can happen when it is cold or hot outside it just evaporates faster when it is hot and slower in the cold.;WA.18.365.1;1
3852;WA_18;I disagree because water can evaporate any time. Just when it is hot it evaporates quicker than when its cold.;WA.18.367.1;1
3853;WA_18;Yes I agree because when water is hot it fogs up.;WA.18.381.1;0
3854;WA_18;Water evaporation is also predicted by the volume mass.;WA.18.383.1;0
3855;WA_18;I disagree because the surface area effects the evaporation. Also it just takes more time when the water is cold.;WA.18.385.1;1
3856;WA_18;I disagree because it can also evaporate in air movement or when it is exposed to more air.;WA.18.386.1;0
3857;WA_18;Disagree because there are more ways to make things evaporate, including, putting it by morning air.;WA.18.423.1;0
3858;WA_18;I agree because anything with water on it in the heat will evaporate.;WA.18.451.1;0
3859;WA_18;I disagree because if it rains the next day is gone.;WA.18.452.1;0
3860;WA_18;I disagree because water can evaporate when it is breezy too!;WA.18.455.1;0
3861;WA_18;I disagree because water can evaporate at any temperature.;WA.18.456.1;1
3862;WA_18;I disagree. Water can evaporate at any temperature. Make the water make it evaporate faster.;WA.18.465.1;1
3863;WA_18;I disagree because the water after it rains evaporates and it is not hot outside.;WA.18.466.1;1
3864;WA_18;I disagree because evaporation is also involved with surface tension.;WA.18.468.1;0
3865;WA_18;Agree because heat can help the time of evaporation.;WA.18.469.1;0
3866;WA_18;I disagree because water does not always evaporate in hot water.;WA.18.486.1;1
3867;WA_18;That is not true if you leave water out on a air conditioner for a month it will evaporate no heat needed.;WA.18.492.1;1
3868;WA_18;I agree because if the temperature is higher the water will evaporate more.;WA.18.493.1;0
3869;WA_18;I disagree. Because any water left out long enough will evaporate.;WA.18.495.1;0
3870;WA_18;I disagree because it also depends on surface area and light. Something with light might evaporate more slowly than something with a lot of heat, but it will still evaporate.;WA.18.497.1;0
3871;WA_18;I disagree. Evaporation can happen if the water is cold, it just takes longer.;WA.18.500.1;1
3872;WA_18;Disagree. That is true, but there are better ways to say like, the water starts to steam at 212 and the molecules in the water start to jump around then and contract to the cold air because they are so hot that the molecules jump out and turn cold and get smaller and smaller.;WA.18.501.1;0
3873;WA_18;I agree because the higher the temperature, the more evaporation. But evaporation does happen with cold water to.;WA.18.503.1;0
3874;WA_18;Because on the floor it was not piled on top of each other. So there was more room to evaporate, so in the cup it was all confined so it had less room to evaporate.;WA.18.509.1;0
3875;WA_18;I disagree because if you put a cup of water at a high elevation it is still going to evaporate.;WA.18.510.1;0
3876;WA_18;I agree because hot air raises water molecules.;WA.18.524.1;0
3877;WA_18;I disagree. The water in a hot area evaporates faster but cold water still evaporates just not as quickly.;WA.18.527.1;1
3878;WA_18;I disagree because sometimes if you leave water spilled it would eventually evaporate.;WA.18.528.1;1
3879;WA_18;Well it mostly happen when it is hot but it does not always, so I disagree!;WA.18.531.1;1
3880;WA_18;I disagree that evaporation only happens when it is heated it happens all the time heated or not.;WA.18.532.1;1
3881;WA_18;I agree because in our class we tried it and the cup outside did not evaporate that much because it was cold and the cup on the inside evaporated a lot and it was hot.;WA.18.533.1;0
3882;WA_18;It happens at any temperature but it is faster at high temperatures.;WA.18.537.1;1
3883;WA_18;Agree because it has to be hot.;WA.18.539.1;0
3884;WA_18;No, because if you take a clear cap and fill it with water put a cap on it and put it in a sunny spot and let it sit for long that is a way to.;WA.18.541.1;0
3885;WA_18;I disagree because evaporation happens if there is any temperature water, but it will evaporate faster with warm air.;WA.18.556.1;1
3886;WA_18;I agree because water only evaporates when heat is near by.;WA.18.557.1;0
3887;WA_18;I agree because steam is hot water flying around and taking the water out the cup.;WA.18.558.1;0
3888;WA_18;I disagree because evaporation happens when water is cold.;WA.18.564.1;1
3889;WA_18;I disagree because I heard evaporation is always happening and water is not always hot.;WA.18.565.1;1
3890;WA_18;Yes I do agree because the sun shows how hot it can be with evaporation.;WA.18.566.1;0
3891;WA_18;That is not true because the oceans can be cold but they still evaporate. Evaporation happens every second of every minute of everyday of every year!;WA.18.567.1;1
3892;WA_18;Agree the sun is hot and the ground water evaporated.;WA.18.595.1;0
3893;WA_18;I agree because water vapor is what gets evaporated. Water vapor is often times heat. If water is extremely cold it freezes.;WA.18.596.1;0
3894;WA_18;I disagree because water can evaporate higher than 32 degrees Fahrenheit.;WA.18.598.1;1
3895;WA_18;I disagree when water spills or is in a cup it evaporates.;WA.18.603.1;0
3896;WA_18;I disagree if I spill water on my clothes it was probably cold water and it evaporates.;WA.18.604.1;1
3897;WA_18;I disagree because hot water evaporates faster than cold but they both do evaporate.;WA.18.608.1;1
3898;WA_18;I agree because you need hot air to evaporate something.;WA.18.610.1;0
3899;WA_18;I disagree because any temperature water can evaporate.;WA.18.612.1;1
3900;WA_18;That's not true because my group put ours in the freezer and it evaporated a little bit.;WA.18.631.1;1
3901;WA_18;I disagree because it can happen on any kinds of water.;WA.18.632.1;0
3902;WA_18;I disagree because when water is cold water is froze it gets smaller and evaporation.;WA.18.641.1;0
3903;WA_18;Yes because water is cold then heat hits it then it turns to water vapor. Then goes up to the air.;WA.18.642.1;0
3904;WA_22;The reason condensation makes rain is because a lake evaporates and then it condenses and then it rains back into the lake.;WA.22.171.1;1
3905;WA_22;Evaporation because when water evaporates it is the water that will become rain and if water did not evaporate there would be no rain.;WA.22.181.1;0
3906;WA_22;Both evaporation and condensation are processes that involve causing rain because first, when there is a cup of water, the sun would evaporate the water and turn it into water vapor, then the water vapor would touch a cool surface and start condensation. Then the condensation would go to the clouds and cause rain.;WA.22.182.1;1
3907;WA_22;Because first it evaporates then it turns into condensation then it rains.;WA.22.189.1;1
3908;WA_22;Condensation is involved in causing rain is because when rain falls it is called precipitation and then falls on a cool surface and that is called condensation.;WA.22.190.1;0
3909;WA_22;Well when the water is anywhere evaporation picks up the water and turns it into water vapor and so on and so on.;WA.22.191.1;0
3910;WA_22;Because evaporation evaporates goes up in the air and makes clouds forms a bigger cloud and that cloud gets role of water and then it rains.;WA.22.194.1;0
3911;WA_22;Because evaporation and condensation can go into the clouds.;WA.22.195.1;0
3912;WA_22;I chose both evaporation and condensation because when water evaporates it turns into water vapor when there is enough it forms rain clouds then condensation happens and forms rain.;WA.22.207.1;1
3913;WA_22;Because the water from the 38 grams went into the air and became clouds and make the air more sticky.;WA.22.208.1;0
3914;WA_22;Was evaporation makes a cloud full of water vapor then that cloud becomes rain.;WA.22.212.1;0
3915;WA_22;Well evaporation makes water go into the air which sometimes go into clouds, and condensation makes water rain down on us.;WA.22.214.1;1
3916;WA_22;Because water evaporates and makes condensation and condensation makes clouds and clouds make rain.;WA.22.218.1;1
3917;WA_22;Because but evaporation is air condensation is like cloud and rain.;WA.22.221.1;0
3918;WA_22;Because evaporation causes the water to go up in the air, and condensation makes clouds which eventually form precipitation or rain.;WA.22.223.1;1
3919;WA_22;Evaporation evaporates water into clouds. Condensation makes clouds.;WA.22.226.1;1
3920;WA_22;Because water gets evaporated.;WA.22.227.1;0
3921;WA_22;They both have something to do with rain because evaporation evaporates the water into the air and makes it water vapor. The water vapor condenses and makes clouds filled with water and then the cloud touches a cool surface and condensation makes the liquid water back into water and it rains.;WA.22.229.1;1
3922;WA_22;I chose C evaporation and condensation because one cannot happen without the other.;WA.22.232.1;0
3923;WA_22;I picked a because that is it causes rain.;WA.22.243.1;0
3924;WA_22;They are both involved because water evaporate to the clouds, the it rains, then it condensates.;WA.22.244.1;1
3925;WA_22;Because water will evaporate from a cool place and water vapor will go into the clouds and will hit a cool place and form condensation.;WA.22.249.1;1
3926;WA_22;The reason why I chose this answer is because condensation causes fog.;WA.22.251.1;0
3927;WA_22;Evaporation and condensation happen in the rain because the water evaporates from the ground and hits a cooler surface and turns into condensation.;WA.22.252.1;1
3928;WA_22;I choose this answer because in the water cycle from the ocean some water evaporates into a cloud until it cannot hold it anymore and then it rains.;WA.22.256.1;0
3929;WA_22;Evaporation is a process involving rain because the water evaporates and turns into clouds.;WA.22.261.1;0
3930;WA_22;I picked A because the water evaporates then goes into the cloud that cools it down then it rains then it starts all over again.;WA.22.262.1;0
3931;WA_22;Evaporation in the sky it evaporation into the sky it make rain.;WA.22.265.1;0
3932;WA_22;I think C. Because water evaporates and goes in the clouds and falls down as rain.;WA.22.266.1;0
3933;WA_22;Both evaporation and condensation are involved in causing rain. Evaporation forms clouds and condensation makes it rain.;WA.22.279.1;1
3934;WA_22;Because evaporation is when water goes into the air.;WA.22.287.1;0
3935;WA_22;The water from lakes, rivers, oceans, canals, evaporates into the clouds and when the clouds get full of water it rains.;WA.22.294.1;0
3936;WA_22;Because the air in the cloud condensed into rain and the rain came down on the earth.;WA.22.299.1;0
3937;WA_22;You need both, evaporation and condensation to make it rain. It goes like this. First it rains, second the water goes into the ocean. The water heats up and evaporates in the air. Then in the clouds it cools. Then it condenses and rains again.;WA.22.301.1;1
3938;WA_22;When water evaporates it goes to the clouds and the cloud gets heavy and it rains.;WA.22.348.1;0
3939;WA_22;Evaporation is when the water vapor goes into the clouds. Condensation is when the water vapor turns into water.;WA.22.352.1;1
3940;WA_22;Evaporation and condensation are both involved in causing rain. Because, to have clouds water has to evaporate. And to rain the water in the cloud gets too heavy so it rains that is called condensation.;WA.22.360.1;0
3941;WA_22;Because the water cycle says it warms up, evaporates through the clouds, and cools, then it is condensation.;WA.22.362.1;1
3942;WA_22;I picked C. Because to cause rain it would have to have both evaporation and condensation.;WA.22.364.1;0
3943;WA_22;It needs evaporation to get the water, then the clouds soak it all up until it cannot hold any more. Then when it rains it is called condensation.;WA.22.367.1;0
3944;WA_22;Because the water needs to evaporate and go into the clouds or air to fall down and make condensation.;WA.22.368.1;0
3945;WA_22;Because evaporation makes the cloud, while condensation lets the cloud lose water.;WA.22.383.1;1
3946;WA_22;First water has to evaporate into the air. When it builds up in the clouds it rains.;WA.22.384.1;0
3947;WA_22;Because to get water in the clouds you need water vapor which is evaporated and then to get rain you need condensation.;WA.22.385.1;1
3948;WA_22;To get the rain water into clouds, the water has to evaporate into vapor. As clouds to make rain come down the vapor has to condense. Then rain falls and the process starts over.;WA.22.416.1;1
3949;WA_22;In order to rain you need evaporation because the water evaporates into the air and you need condensation to rain it down.;WA.22.418.1;1
3950;WA_22;Both evaporation and condensation, because, evaporation forms condensation which goes to the clouds and then the clouds rain and then the process starts over again.;WA.22.423.1;0
3951;WA_22;Evaporation turns water in water vapor so water vapor get in the clouds. Condensation make water vapor turns into water and rain.;WA.22.426.1;1
3952;WA_22;How it rains is it evaporates and then it rains from the clouds.;WA.22.427.1;0
3953;WA_22;To make rain clouds you need water, water vapor is water that has been evaporated.;WA.22.428.1;0
3954;WA_22;When evaporation it up in the air when the air cools and then water to water condensation and fall to the ground as rain.;WA.22.430.1;1
3955;WA_22;Evaporation because when water evaporates it goes into the air and forms clouds. The rain rains down from the clouds.;WA.22.432.1;0
3956;WA_22;Water needs to evaporate into the sky and then condense into clouds which causes rain to fall.;WA.22.435.1;1
3957;WA_22;Since when water evaporates it goes in clouds then when it condenses and it comes down as rain.;WA.22.436.1;1
3958;WA_22;Because you need condensation in the clouds for it to rain and if it does not evaporate it will not be able to rain.;WA.22.451.1;1
3959;WA_22;Because condensation is when water vapor changes to water which is rain. Evaporation is when water changes to water vapor going up to the clouds.;WA.22.454.1;1
3960;WA_22;Because the water on the ground evaporated became water vapor came to the clouds, the water condensed plus rained.;WA.22.455.1;1
3961;WA_22;Because when it is water vapor it turns into rain back into water.;WA.22.458.1;0
3962;WA_22;If water never evaporated condensation could never happen.;WA.22.459.1;0
3963;WA_22;Because you need the water to evaporate then condensation makes it turn back into water and then it rains.;WA.22.466.1;1
3964;WA_22;I said evaporation because condensation it gets on the outside of the cup and evaporation with when water goes into the sky.;WA.22.468.1;0
3965;WA_22;Because evaporation is when water goes into the air and travels to the atmosphere then condenses becomes water again to make a cloud.;WA.22.487.1;1
3966;WA_22;Because it goes into the air and into the clouds and the clouds rain that water that evaporates.;WA.22.490.1;0
3967;WA_22;Because when water evaporates it goes up and when you get a lot up there it condenses and comes down as rain, snow, sleet, hail?;WA.22.492.1;1
3968;WA_22;Because when cool water melts hot water.;WA.22.493.1;0
3969;WA_22;Because evaporation causes water vapor to form clouds, then condensation turns water vapor into the rain that falls from the sky.;WA.22.495.1;1
3970;WA_22;I do not know what condensations means, that is why I picked it, because evaporation means water just disappears.;WA.22.503.1;0
3971;WA_22;Because, when it rains it is called condensation and when it evaporates up to the clouds it rains again. So it makes the water cycle.;WA.22.504.1;1
3972;WA_22;The water has to evaporate into the clouds and condenses rain.;WA.22.505.1;0
3973;WA_22;Liquid water evaporate from earth up into the air. Then it forms clouds, and become a liquid or condense. Then it will precipitate, or fall as rain.;WA.22.506.1;1
3974;WA_22;C, because you have to have the whole cycle for rain to happen.;WA.22.521.1;0
3975;WA_22;Evaporation and condensation have to happen so precipitation can happen.;WA.22.522.1;0
3976;WA_22;Because evaporation gets the water up into the air and condensation makes the water vapor drops of water and soon after that it rains.;WA.22.524.1;1
3977;WA_22;The water cycle. You need to have passed evaporation and condensation to have precipitation or rain fall.;WA.22.529.1;0
3978;WA_22;Because, water has to evaporate to create clouds, and condensate to rain.;WA.22.530.1;1
3979;WA_22;Evaporation makes the clouds pouring, and condensation is the clouds!;WA.22.531.1;0
3980;WA_22;Both evaporation and condensation because they both have to do something with rain.;WA.22.532.1;0
3981;WA_22;Because to make rain water has to evaporate from the ocean and then there has to be condensation for rain to be made.;WA.22.533.1;1
3982;WA_22;Clouds are what causes rain. The water that made the clouds evaporated and then condensed.;WA.22.534.1;1
3983;WA_22;Because water evaporates and rises in the air to form clouds.;WA.22.535.1;0
3984;WA_22;Water evaporates from the ground and condense into clouds and eventually into rain.;WA.22.537.1;0
3985;WA_22;Evaporation and condensation cause rain to happen.;WA.22.542.1;0
3986;WA_22;Rain can be in a puddle and evaporate.;WA.22.558.1;0
3987;WA_22;I think that because if the evaporation did not happen how could the clouds form then get heavier a rain? So that's why I think so.;WA.22.561.1;0
3988;WA_22;Evaporation sends the water into the atmosphere, condensation forms a cloud and rain comes from clouds and rain is called precipitation.;WA.22.565.1;1
3989;WA_22;The water in the clouds condenses back into precipitation and precipitation is rain or snow.;WA.22.569.1;0
3990;WA_22;Both because evaporation makes clouds and the condensation in the clouds gets so heavy it precipitates rains.;WA.22.575.1;0
3991;WA_22;Because it turns from water liquid to gas. Called condensation.;WA.22.576.1;0
3992;WA_22;When the evaporation takes places the condensation make the droplets on the window.;WA.22.595.1;0
3993;WA_22;Because at my house when it rains by the next day it had evaporate and left condensation on our windows.;WA.22.599.1;0
3994;WA_22;I think both are because evaporation brings up groundwater and then it condenses which makes rain so yes it is C.;WA.22.604.1;1
3995;WA_22;Because if you put some color water in a cup with no lid it will evaporate then when it is in the clouds it will rain down.;WA.22.610.1;0
3996;WA_22;Evaporation because it cannot rain if the water does not go into the air. Clouds.;WA.22.627.1;0
3997;WA_22;I disagree. Evaporation happens in every temperature. But has more evaporating in High temperature.;WA.22.628.1;0
3998;WA_22;I looked at a chart.;WA.22.630.1;0
3999;WA_22;Because when water vapor is in the air the rain falls down and turns into condensation.;WA.22.632.1;0
4000;WA_22;Because when water evaporates it goes to the clouds so it gets fuller when it is really full it causes rain.;WA.22.634.1;0
4001;WA_22;Evaporation because it goes up in the cloud and then it rains.;WA.22.641.1;0
4002;WA_22;Because it evaporated up to the air then it becomes condense the turns to cloud. Then starts to rain.;WA.22.642.1;1
4003;WA_22;Condensation when the rain falls it goes under the ground than evaporation.;WA.22.643.1;0
4004;WA_31;Their masses were different because the water on the sponge evaporated. If you leave water out for a certain period of time, it will evaporate.;WA.31.172.1;1
4005;WA_31;The mass was different because water evaporated from the sponge before they weighed it again so the weight changed.;WA.31.173.1;1
4006;WA_31;Well because the water probably evaporated 16 grams the day Maria weighed the sponge. When Jose weighed it, it was probably lighter.;WA.31.176.1;1
4007;WA_31;They were different because if you leave water out it will evaporate. Some of the water in the sponge evaporated.;WA.31.177.1;1
4008;WA_31;Because water is really strong and it could make a sponge heavier but when it dried, water was not on the sponge no more so that made it weigh lower.;WA.31.179.1;0
4009;WA_31;They were different because all of the water in the sponge evaporated and water is heavy so it made the sponge heavy but when it evaporated it made the sponge weigh lighter.;WA.31.181.1;1
4010;WA_31;Overnight the water in the sponge had evaporated so that sponge weighed less.;WA.31.186.1;1
4011;WA_31;Because over the hours the sponge evaporated.;WA.31.189.1;0
4012;WA_31;The masses were different because Maria probably left the balance by a heated source. If she had left it by a heated source, the wet sponge the water in it might have evaporated.;WA.31.190.1;1
4013;WA_31;Because when Maria weighed it, it had water in it and when Jose weighed it, the water had already evaporated.;WA.31.194.1;1
4014;WA_31;Because some of the water from the sponge evaporated.;WA.31.195.1;1
4015;WA_31;The water in the sponge evaporated.;WA.31.196.1;1
4016;WA_31;The sponge has water in it. The water evaporated and made the sponge not as heavy.;WA.31.197.1;1
4017;WA_31;That happened because when you leave something out it will get evaporated.;WA.31.211.1;0
4018;WA_31;Because it evaporated.;WA.31.218.1;0
4019;WA_31;The masses were different because the water on the sponge evaporated.;WA.31.226.1;1
4020;WA_31;The masses were different because some water evaporated.;WA.31.230.1;1
4021;WA_31;The masses were different because some of the water in the sponge had evaporated.;WA.31.231.1;1
4022;WA_31;Because overnight some of the water in the sponge evaporated.;WA.31.232.1;1
4023;WA_31;Water has evaporated from the sponge over the night, making the sponge less heavy.;WA.31.242.1;1
4024;WA_31;The masses were different because some of the water evaporated.;WA.31.248.1;1
4025;WA_31;The sponge evaporated some water.;WA.31.254.1;1
4026;WA_31;The masses were different because when Maria left it on the balance, the water evaporated and made the sponge lighter.;WA.31.255.1;1
4027;WA_31;The masses were different because within the next day some of the water evaporated out of the sponge, so now that it has lost some of its water, it weighs less.;WA.31.257.1;1
4028;WA_31;The masses were different because some of the water on the damp sponge evaporated.;WA.31.258.1;1
4029;WA_31;The mass was different because some water evaporated from the sponge and made it weigh less.;WA.31.262.1;1
4030;WA_31;Because maybe Maria put in more water than Jose.;WA.31.264.1;0
4031;WA_31;The masses were different because some water evaporated overnight.;WA.31.266.1;1

4038;WA_31;The wind and the water.;WA.31.381.1;0
4039;WA_31;Because overnight, the water got warmer somehow.;WA.31.383.1;0
4040;WA_31;That must have been from evaporation. The water on the sponge probably evaporated.;WA.31.387.1;1
4041;WA_31;Because the sponge was left there all night, so most of the water from the sponge evaporated. Maria weighed the sponge when it was still very wet, but Jose weighed it when the water had already evaporated.;WA.31.390.1;1
4042;WA_31;Because the sponge evaporated.;WA.31.392.1;0
4043;WA_31;Maria let the sponge sit and water from the sponge evaporated and took water out of the sponge and turned it into water vapor so the sponge got lighter since it had less mass.;WA.31.395.1;1
4044;WA_31;Because the sponge dried when Maria left.;WA.31.397.1;0
4045;WA_31;The water on the sponge was evaporated, so Jose's sponge was lighter than Maria's.;WA.31.401.1;1
4046;WA_31;Because the water inside the sponge had partly evaporated.;WA.31.416.1;1
4047;WA_31;They were different because the first day the sponge was heavy with water, but the next day the water had evaporated, so it had lost weight since the day before.;WA.31.422.1;1
4048;WA_31;Because Jose wet it the day before he looked at it, so it evaporated.;WA.31.425.1;0
4049;WA_31;Because the water in the sponge evaporated.;WA.31.426.1;1
4050;WA_31;Because some of the water evaporated, making it turn into water vapor.;WA.31.428.1;1
4051;WA_31;The water evaporated. That made it weigh less.;WA.31.430.1;1
4052;WA_31;Because the next day the water in the sponge evaporated. If she put the sponge in a case, it would not evaporate fast.;WA.31.433.1;1
4053;WA_31;Because it evaporated so there is not more water in it. Water cause weight too.;WA.31.434.1;0
4054;WA_31;The water in the sponge evaporated the next day which made it lighter.;WA.31.436.1;1

4058;WA_31;The water in the wet sponge evaporated.;WA.31.458.1;1
4059;WA_31;It is called evaporation. It evaporated because it could have been in heat or the sun.;WA.31.460.1;0
4060;WA_31;Some of the water in the sponge evaporated.;WA.31.463.1;1
4061;WA_31;Maria weighed the sponge when it was wet. Then the water evaporated and Jose weighed it.;WA.31.465.1;1
4062;WA_31;Some of the water evaporated from the cup.;WA.31.469.1;0
4063;WA_31;They were different because the water caused the sponge to get heavy and the next day when Jose found the sponge some of the water on the sponge has evaporated.;WA.31.486.1;1
4064;WA_31;Because overnight the water in the sponge evaporated so there was no water and it weighed less.;WA.31.487.1;1
4065;WA_31;The sponge's water evaporated.;WA.31.493.1;1
4066;WA_31;Since it was a wet sponge, the water that was inside of it evaporated so it made it weigh less.;WA.31.498.1;1
4067;WA_31;Because the water in the sponge start to evaporate because some of the water gets hot and contracts to the less dense molecules. So then there is less water in the sponge.;WA.31.501.1;1
4068;WA_31;Because some water in the sponge evaporated and less water meant less weight.;WA.31.505.1;1
4069;WA_31;Because the water in the sponge evaporated, so a bit of weight went with it.;WA.31.506.1;1
4070;WA_31;Because some of the water evaporated. So that caused the weight of the sponge to decrease.;WA.31.509.1;1
4071;WA_31;Because some of the water from Maria's cup evaporated.;WA.31.510.1;0
4072;WA_31;Because it was getting dry easily because it evaporated.;WA.31.512.1;0

4076;WA_31;Because some of the water in the wet sponge evaporated.;WA.31.528.1;1
4077;WA_31;Well the sponge must have evaporated a little since the day before.;WA.31.531.1;1
4078;WA_31;Because the water evaporated in the sponge.;WA.31.532.1;1
4079;WA_31;Because the sponge soaks up the water in it.;WA.31.535.1;0
4080;WA_31;Because water does weigh something. If the sponge is wet one day the next it will be dryer, and weigh less.;WA.31.536.1;0
4081;WA_31;Because the water in the sponge evaporated.;WA.31.541.1;1
4082;WA_31;Because the water evaporated, and the sponge weighed its normal weight without water.;WA.31.556.1;1
4083;WA_31;Because most is closest of evaporation.;WA.31.557.1;0
4084;WA_31;Because if it was outside all the water dried up which made it weigh less. It weighed more with the water in.;WA.31.563.1;0
4085;WA_31;The water in the sponge evaporated so it weighed less because water weighs a certain amount.;WA.31.565.1;1
4086;WA_31;Because the water in the sponge evaporated overnight. Water is more dense than air. So when there was water in the sponge other than nothing but air in the sponge!;WA.31.567.1;1
4087;WA_31;The masses were different because part of the water evaporated.;WA.31.572.1;1
4088;WA_31;Because some of it evaporated into the air.;WA.31.576.1;0
4089;WA_31;Because when Maria weighed it was full of water but when Jose weighed it the sponge had dried.;WA.31.591.1;0
4090;WA_31;Water can weigh a substance down. When water from the sponge is evaporated, it gets lighter.;WA.31.596.1;1
4091;WA_31;Because of evaporation.;WA.31.598.1;0
4092;WA_31;Because of evaporation the water from the sponge evaporated into the Air!;WA.31.600.1;1
4093;WA_31;Overnight the water must have evaporated.;WA.31.604.1;1
4094;WA_31;The masses were different because some of the sponge's water evaporated overnight.;WA.31.610.1;1

4098;WA_31;They used different sponges.;WA.31.630.1;0
4099;WA_31;Because some of the water evaporated from the sponge!;WA.31.631.1;1
4100;WA_31;Because some of the water might have evaporated into the sky. It might have turned into water vapor.;WA.31.635.1;1
4101;WA_31;Because some of the water evaporated and turned into water vapor.;WA.31.638.1;1
4102;WA_31;Because it evaporated the water.;WA.31.639.1;0
4103;WA_31;Because the water on the sponge was evaporated.;WA.31.642.1;1
4104;WA_51;Because the water on the floor had more room to evaporate and in the cup it only had a little bit of room.;WA.51.171.1;0
4105;WA_51;The water on the floor had a bigger space, more open, to evaporate and the cup had smaller space, less space, to evaporate.;WA.51.176.1;0
4106;WA_51;The wider the surface the faster evaporation the skinnier the surface the less evaporation.;WA.51.178.1;0
4107;WA_51;The water evaporated at it was in the air.;WA.51.180.1;0
4108;WA_51;It all evaporated because the water on the floor was wider and had more area while the cup full of water did not have as much area and the more area you have the easier it is to evaporate.;WA.51.181.1;0
4109;WA_51;Well Anna, in science, I learned that when water is in a more open area, then water evaporates faster. So, since tile and floor do not have any boundaries or wall covering the outside, the water on the floor evaporated faster, but since the water in the cup has boundaries, the water in the cup did not evaporate as fast.;WA.51.182.1;0
4110;WA_51;Well the water on the floor had evaporated faster because, there was nothing surrounding it. Also the water in the cup surrounded so it evaporated slowly.;WA.51.184.1;0
4111;WA_51;The water on the floor evaporated because of a situation called condensation.;WA.51.185.1;0
4112;WA_51;The floor has a wider surface area than the cup so the water on the floor evaporated faster than the water in the cup.;WA.51.186.1;1
4113;WA_51;Because the more the water is exposed the faster it will evaporate.;WA.51.188.1;0
4114;WA_51;When water has more room to evaporate like on the floor it evaporates faster. When it is in a cup it evaporates slower because it has less room to evaporate.;WA.51.189.1;0
4115;WA_51;The water on the floor had more surface area so it evaporated quickly.;WA.51.193.1;1
4116;WA_51;The water on the floor evaporated faster because larger surface.;WA.51.196.1;0
4117;WA_51;Because the floor has more surface area than the cup and the widest surface area the more evaporation.;WA.51.198.1;1
4118;WA_51;The water on the floor spread out and had a bigger surface area causing the water to evaporate at a quicker rate.;WA.51.206.1;1
4119;WA_51;The water on the floor evaporated quicker because of the surface area was big. But the water in the cup evaporated slower because the surface area was small.;WA.51.209.1;1
4120;WA_51;The reason the water on the floor evaporated is because it had more space to spread out and the cup did not.;WA.51.214.1;0
4121;WA_51;Because of the floor has a bigger surface area and the cup does not.;WA.51.215.1;1
4122;WA_51;The water on the floor changed to water vapor and the water vapor changed to the water in the cup.;WA.51.216.1;0
4123;WA_51;The water vapor had to take the water on the floor but the water vapor in the cup did not.;WA.51.219.1;0
4124;WA_51;Because the bigger the surface area is the more evaporation will happen.;WA.51.220.1;0
4125;WA_51;It evaporated because you left it on the floor for a long time and the cup water was still there because it was not on the floor but it still evaporated a little in the cup.;WA.51.221.1;0
4126;WA_51;The water on the floor had a bigger space so it evaporated faster.;WA.51.222.1;0
4127;WA_51;Because the cup had less surface area, and the water on the ground had more surface area, and water evaporates easier when there is more surface area.;WA.51.223.1;1
4128;WA_51;Well, the water on the floor had more surface area to evaporate. The water in the cup had less surface area. So, the water on the floor could evaporate faster.;WA.51.226.1;1
4129;WA_51;That the water on the floor was more spread out than the cup and the bigger the surface area the faster something evaporates.;WA.51.229.1;1
4130;WA_51;The water in the cup did evaporate, but the water on the floor that evaporated was in the air and went into you cup.;WA.51.231.1;0
4131;WA_51;Most of the water on the floor evaporated because it had a lot of surface area and in the cup it did not have a lot of surface area and the bigger the surface area the more it evaporates.;WA.51.248.1;1
4132;WA_51;Most of the water that she spilled evaporated more because it had more surface area and the cup had smaller area.;WA.51.250.1;1
4133;WA_51;Most of the water on the floor evaporate because the surface area is a lot bigger than the surface area on the opening of the cup.;WA.51.252.1;1
4134;WA_51;The water on the floor had evaporated but the cup water did not because the floor had the larger surface area which allowed the water to evaporate quicker. The cup water did not.;WA.51.257.1;1
4135;WA_51;Because the water on the floor was open to the air and had more surface area, but the cup had less surface area and was not really open to the air.;WA.51.262.1;1
4136;WA_51;The water on the floor had more room for the water to evaporate and the water in the cup did not have as much room.;WA.51.263.1;0
4137;WA_51;Because it was probably hot and it all evaporated and the water in the cup was probably cold.;WA.51.264.1;0
4138;WA_51;Water on the floor evaporated on the floor but the water in the cup did not evaporate.;WA.51.265.1;0
4139;WA_51;The reason is the water on the floor had more surface area so it evaporated quicker, and the cup had less surface area so it evaporated slower.;WA.51.266.1;1
4140;WA_51;Because of the opening on the floor it had nothing around it and the cup water it did not have as big as an opening.;WA.51.267.1;0
4141;WA_51;First, the water on the floor had more surface area. So it evaporated quicker. Although the water in the cup had less surface area. So it evaporated slower.;WA.51.279.1;1
4142;WA_51;Because the water on the kitchen floor had more room on the floor and the cup did not.;WA.51.281.1;0
4143;WA_51;The water on the floor had more surface area than the water in the cup.;WA.51.282.1;1
4144;WA_51;The water on the floor evaporated into the air faster.;WA.51.287.1;0
4145;WA_51;Because the water on the floor had more surface area, and the water in the cup did not.;WA.51.346.1;1
4146;WA_51;Because the water is not in the cup. So the water went up into the air and went to the clouds.;WA.51.350.1;0
4147;WA_51;Anna the water on the floor had been evaporated. Evaporate means it went up into the air.;WA.51.356.1;0
4148;WA_51;Because the water warms up, and so it might have went through the vent duct, outside and evaporated in the clouds.;WA.51.362.1;0
4149;WA_51;It was spread out like surface area that is why it evaporates fast..;WA.51.370.1;0
4150;WA_51;The water on the floor was more exposed to the air, the water in the cup had a more closed surface.;WA.51.384.1;0
4151;WA_51;The water on the floor evaporated because it had a lot of surface area. The water in the cup did not evaporate as fast because it did not have as much surface area.;WA.51.390.1;1
4152;WA_51;Because most of the water in the cup has cup for heated and custody but the water on the floor will be evaporate because they have not custody and heated things.;WA.51.397.1;0
4153;WA_51;Because the water that was on the floor had more space and it was spread out. The water in the cup had less space.;WA.51.399.1;0
4154;WA_51;Because the larger space is easier to be evaporated. The water on the floor is quickly to become water vapor.;WA.51.402.1;0
4155;WA_51;The water on the floor evaporated before the water in the cup because the water on the floor had more air exposed to the water than the cup. When water has more air exposed to the air it evaporates faster.;WA.51.417.1;0
4156;WA_51;The water on the floor had more surface area than the cup so the water on the floor evaporated faster.;WA.51.422.1;1
4157;WA_51;Because the water on the floor exposed more surface area.;WA.51.424.1;1
4158;WA_51;That's because when water has more room the faster it evaporates and opposite for the cup.;WA.51.425.1;0
4159;WA_51;Because the floors' amount of surface area is bigger. Bigger the quicker.;WA.51.426.1;1
4160;WA_51;The floor water was exposed to air more than the cup.;WA.51.427.1;0
4161;WA_51;Because the water on the floor had more surface area which made it evaporate faster.;WA.51.428.1;1
4162;WA_51;Because there was more exposed water on the floor.;WA.51.429.1;0
4163;WA_51;The water with the largest surface area evaporating the fastest.;WA.51.430.1;1
4164;WA_51;The floor has more surface area than the cup which causes the water to evaporate more quicker than the water in the cup.;WA.51.435.1;1
4165;WA_51;The water that was on the floor was exposed more to air so it evaporated quicker.;WA.51.436.1;0
4166;WA_51;The water on the floor evaporated because it had a big surface area and the cup did not because it had a smaller surface area.;WA.51.451.1;1
4167;WA_51;Because the floor was not and the cup was cold.;WA.51.452.1;0
4168;WA_51;Water vapor.;WA.51.453.1;0
4169;WA_51;Because the floor had a open space for all the water to evaporate, but the cup did not.;WA.51.454.1;0
4170;WA_51;The water on the floor had to evaporate because it had to but the water in the cup was surrounded by walls.;WA.51.489.1;0
4171;WA_51;Because if you spill it on the floor, there is more space, it is more spread out than the cup. Because more air is able to get to the water on the floor faster.;WA.51.490.1;0
4172;WA_51;Since the water on the floor spread out it had more surface area. The more surface area, the quicker evaporation takes place.;WA.51.495.1;1
4173;WA_51;Anna the water has more space on the ground than in a cup so on the ground it has more air to evaporate into than the cup.;WA.51.498.1;0
4174;WA_51;The reason why the water on the floor evaporated is because there was a lot of surface area. The water in the cup was still there because all the water was very close together and water does not evaporate when there is a lot.;WA.51.503.1;1
4175;WA_51;I disagree because evaporation is when water is made into vapor and in cold places like Wisconsin. Water evaporates outside and though heat speeds up the process it is not necessary.;WA.51.509.1;0
4176;WA_51;The water on the floor is open to air. The water in the cup is not open to as much air. A lot evaporates when it is warm.;WA.51.529.1;0
4177;WA_51;The water in the cup did not evaporate because the surface area of the floor is greater than the cup's.;WA.51.534.1;1
4178;WA_51;Does not know.;WA.51.539.1;0
4179;WA_51;Because the water on the floor had evaporated because it was easier for it to evaporate . But the water left in the cup was surrounded by walls so it was harder for it to evaporate.;WA.51.541.1;0
4180;WA_51;The liquid water evaporated because it was probably sunny.;WA.51.542.1;0
4181;WA_51;The cup has less shape than the floor. The floor is less dense than the cup.;WA.51.558.1;0
4182;WA_51;The water on the floor is probably more warm than the cup so it evaporated faster.;WA.51.559.1;0
4183;WA_51;Because the floor was cooler than the sides of the cup. So the water on the floor evaporated.;WA.51.560.1;0
4184;WA_51;Because the water that was on the floor had more space and it was spread out. The water in the cup had less Because the water on the floor had more air to evaporate into, and the water in the cup did not evaporate because all the water did not have much room. Also the water on the floor spread across the floor so everything could evaporate at once.;WA.51.561.1;0
4185;WA_51;Because when water is in a cup it is harder to evaporate than it is on the floor because the water that is on the floor is spread out.;WA.51.563.1;0
4186;WA_51;Because the water on the floor had more surface area than the water in the cup. The more surface area, the faster the water evaporates.;WA.51.573.1;1
4187;WA_51;The floor is bigger and flat not a circle and a cup is not flat and is round and is big in height.;WA.51.594.1;0
4188;WA_51;The surfaces area. The water was on the ground all over and it evaporated. The water in the cup was too deep for it to evaporate.;WA.51.595.1;1
4189;WA_51;The floor has a bigger surface area than the cup. The larger the surface area. The faster the evaporation.;WA.51.596.1;1
4190;WA_51;The reason why the water on the floor evaporated faster than the water in the cup is because of surface area. The more surface area there is, the faster the water evaporates.;WA.51.597.1;1
4191;WA_51;Because of surface area the larger the surface area the more evaporation.;WA.51.598.1;0
4192;WA_51;When the water fell it moved around so it was thinner than the water in the cup it was so hot that heat made the water on the floor evaporated.;WA.51.599.1;0
4193;WA_51;Probably because the water left in the cup was ice.;WA.51.604.1;0
4194;WA_51;The water on the floor evaporated because the surface area was big and the cup's was not as big.;WA.51.605.1;1
4195;WA_51;The water in the cup probably did not have as much surface area as the water on the floor because the water on the floor was spread out and the water in the cup was not.;WA.51.609.1;1
4196;WA_51;Because on the floor you can get under the water and you cannot in the glass.;WA.51.610.1;0
4197;WA_51;Because the water on the floor was out of something so the air took the water to make it evaporate - disappear but the water in the cup took more longer because it was in something.;WA.51.626.1;0
4198;WA_51;The water on the floor turned into water vapor.;WA.51.632.1;0
4199;WA_51;It was splattered and evaporations faster.;WA.51.633.1;0
4200;WA_51;The water on the floor change to water vapor and rose into the air. The water in the cup water vapor stuck to the side of the cup.;WA.51.637.1;0
4201;WA_51;The floor has more surface area than the cup so the floor evaporated all the water and the cup did not.;WA.51.638.1;1
4202;WA_51;Because when you left some things out it evaporated and turned into water vapor.;WA.51.641.1;0
4203;WA_51;Well the heat hitting the water on the floor so it evaporated. But the one in the cup the heat hit but not the water the cup only. So the cup become condense.;WA.51.642.1;0

4662;WA_29;Cold. The hot water floated and the cold water sank.;WA.29.503.1;1
4663;WA_29;Hot. Heat rises and floats.;WA.29.505.1;0
4664;WA_29;Cold. Because when water molecules are cooled, they want to come close together or contract. This makes it denser.;WA.29.506.1;0
4665;WA_29;Cold water. Because the hot water goes out of the vial and the cold stays weighed down because it is more tightly packed.;WA.29.509.1;1

4682;WA_29;Hot. Because done this same thing before.;WA.29.591.1;0
4683;WA_29;Hot. Because denser means it wants to contract. Less dense means it wants to expand. The hot water contracted and squeezed to the bottom.;WA.29.596.1;0
4684;WA_29;Cold. Cold water goes to the bottom of the room temperature water. The room temperature water tries to push the cold water so it can take over the vial.;WA.29.598.1;1
4685;WA_29;Hot. Because dense means fills up more space.;WA.29.600.1;0

5438;MS_50b;We have started measurement because so that everyone agrees on it.;MS.50b.387.1;1
5439;MS_50b;So you can communicate with other people.;MS.50b.393.1;1
5440;MS_50b;So you knew the temperature.;MS.50b.398.1;1

5442;MS_50b;In case if someone is sick.;MS.50b.423.1;0
5443;MS_50b;So you can know what the answer is.;MS.50b.433.1;0
5444;MS_50b;So people would understand each other.;MS.50b.454.1;1
5445;MS_50b;Because it is important to use standard to measurement.;MS.50b.461.1;0
5446;MS_50b;To communicate.;MS.50b.493.1;1

5450;MS_50b;Because maybe it is bigger or smaller and your hands are bigger or smaller.;MS.50b.504.1;0
5451;MS_50b;So you can get the same answer.;MS.50b.521.1;0
5452;MS_50b;To know what to wear.;MS.50b.532.1;0
5453;MS_50b;So you know how to get the right answer.;MS.50b.566.1;0
5454;MS_50b;You got have a standard measurement for you could know what is the real answer.;MS.50b.569.1;0
5455;MS_50b;So that if you just measure anything else you will not get the right answer.;MS.50b.592.1;0
5456;MS_50b;So you do not get the wrong answer.;MS.50b.598.1;0
