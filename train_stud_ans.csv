201;EM_43b;Get a rock and put it in a vial and pour acid into the vial. Wait a while and when a while is done look in the evaporating dish with your hand lens.;EM.43b.502.1;0
202;EM_43b;Phil should pour the cold acid on the rock and if it fizzes it has calcite in it.;EM.43b.504.1;1
203;EM_43b;The color and the want was like. And he can see the hot or cold. And measure and feel it all. And it is stuff.;EM.43b.521.1;0
204;EM_43b;He would observe that there are bubbles.;EM.43b.557.1;0
205;EM_43b;Put the calcite in the vinegar and you will see bubbles.;EM.43b.564.1;0
206;EM_43b;Vinegar, gas, mineral, rock.;EM.43b.592.1;0
207;EM_43b;Because he should put the acid on the rock and see if it fizzes that means it is calcite.;EM.43b.593.1;1
208;EM_43b;He can do the vinegar test the evaporation test and the hardness test.;EM.43b.602.1;0
209;EM_43b;He should put the acid on the rock and observe for a reaction because calcite reacts with acid by making bubbles. So if the rock fizzes it has calcite in it.;EM.43b.609.1;1
210;EM_43b;That what calcite to when it is in vinegar.;EM.43b.611.1;0
211;EM_43b;Put the rock in vinegar.;EM.43b.615.1;0
212;EM_43b;He would put the vinegar into a vial and put the rock in the vial and if it bubbles it is calcite.;EM.43b.626.1;1
213;EM_43b;If it bubbles it has calcite.;EM.43b.629.1;0
214;EM_43b;If you put the rock in vinegar it should fizzle if it has calcite.;EM.43b.634.1;1
215;EM_43b;Put the rock in vinegar and see if it fills.;EM.43b.639.1;0
216;EM_46;It if looks like salt then the salt is salt crystals. If it has lines in them it is calcite crystals.;EM.46.137.1;0
217;EM_46;Calcite is straight lines.;EM.46.141.1;0
218;EM_46;The calcite crystals have lines. Salt crystal have squares.;EM.46.147.1;1
219;EM_46;The calcite crystals were lines and the salt crystals were pyramids and squares.;EM.46.149.1;1
220;EM_46;You can tell them apart because the calcite is just lines. The salt crystals were pyramids and squares.;EM.46.153.1;1
221;EM_46;Calcite look like this the salt, drew picture, crystals look like this, drew picture.;EM.46.281.1;0
222;EM_46;Salt crystals had an X on them and calcite crystals do not.;EM.46.284.1;0
223;EM_46;The salt crystals look like squares.;EM.46.288.1;0
224;EM_46;The salt crystals were square and the calcite had stripes.;EM.46.356.1;0
225;EM_46;When the crystals of the mock rock you could see them really good and with the minerals, calcite, they were hard to see.;EM.46.383.1;0
226;EM_46;I know that crystals are different than salt crystals because the salt crystals do not have needle like structures.;EM.46.397.1;0
227;EM_46;They both have different crystals in them, the ones that are white are whiter than the calcite test crystals.;EM.46.399.1;0
228;EM_46;The calcite crystals looked liked small white needles, the salt crystals were small white globs and squares with Xs and diamonds.;EM.46.406.1;1
229;EM_46;Well the vinegar if you beating a rock it will store bowl.;EM.46.409.1;0
230;EM_46;The crystals were points and the salt crystal were Xs.;EM.46.422.1;1
231;EM_46;The salt crystals have Xs and the others do not.;EM.46.428.1;0
232;EM_46;One of them was whiter than the other and had more crystals.;EM.46.431.1;0
233;EM_46;I can tell the difference because calcite crystals spread out and salt crystals look like squares.;EM.46.432.1;0
234;EM_46;The salt crystals have Xs in them and the other ones look different.;EM.46.433.1;0
235;EM_46;They are different because crystals from the calcite test are not minerals and the salt crystals are minerals.;EM.46.491.1;0
236;EM_46;I can they are different because of their shape calcite crystals look like needles and salt had squares with Xs inside them.;EM.46.494.1;1
237;EM_46;The salt crystals have little Xs and are square shape.;EM.46.508.1;0
238;EM_46;Because the salt crystals were squares with Xs in them and the calcite crystals were and did not make shapes.;EM.46.523.1;0
239;EM_46;The crystals have Xs inside when calcite has like white spot.;EM.46.557.1;0

241;EM_46;Salt crystals had Xs and the crystals did not.;EM.46.572.1;0
242;EM_46;The crystals did not look much like calcite but the did not look like salt either.;EM.46.576.1;0
243;EM_46;Because the crystals from the calcite test were long and skinny. The salt crystals were fat and had designs on.;EM.46.599.1;1
244;EM_46;The calcite crystals had tall needle patterns and the salt crystals were squares with Xs in them.;EM.46.605.1;1
245;EM_46;The difference is the mineral have a little X in the rock have more color.;EM.46.607.1;0
246;EM_46;Because the crystals from calcite look like little needles and the salt crystals had squares with Xs on them.;EM.46.609.1;1
247;EM_46;The one has Xs is the one look like sauce.;EM.46.615.1;0

249;EM_46;A crystal is signet, and has stuff in the middle. The calcite is clear smooth. Salt crystals look like something is dried up.;EM.46.630.1;0
250;EM_46;If you have a bowl and inside there is a crystal and you put vinegar in the bowl if it has calcite it will look like needles with salt it will look like yes.;EM.46.634.1;0

1057;LF_33b;The clay is there because it has lighter and smaller particles which makes it float to the top.;LF.33b.689.1;1
1058;LF_33b;Because clay is the lightest.;LF.33b.699.1;0
1059;LF_33b;The clay is deposited there because the clay is the lightest and everything else is heavier so it sinks.;LF.33b.701.1;1

1072;LF_34b;It flows that way because you cannot make a river flow uphill.;LF.34b.108.1;0

1075;LF_34b;I think the water flows that way because it is going from happy valley to the river.;LF.34b.177.1;0
1076;LF_34b;Why is that the water flows down away from the mountain.;LF.34b.212.1;1
1077;LF_34b;Because it is big at beginning then slowly gets smaller and branches out.;LF.34b.213.1;0
1078;LF_34b;Because it goes happy valley then the river.;LF.34b.216.1;0
1079;LF_34b;Because it does not go into the mountain.;LF.34b.223.1;0
1080;LF_34b;The river flows from biggest to smallest. That is why.;LF.34b.225.1;0

1082;LF_34b;The delta.;LF.34b.262.1;0
1083;LF_34b;Because the water flow to the basin which is the rose mountains.;LF.34b.357.1;0
1084;LF_34b;It flows in that direction because the water is going high land to low land.;LF.34b.667.1;1
1085;LF_34b;Maybe because the mountains are that way, or there are cracks and the water goes through.;LF.34b.668.1;0
1086;LF_34b;Because the mountain is the highest peak and water flows downhill.;LF.34b.670.1;1
1087;LF_34b;I think that because the water flows down from the mountain first.;LF.34b.673.1;1
1088;LF_34b;Because there are little slots that take them that way.;LF.34b.684.1;0
1089;LF_34b;I think it flows that way because rivers usually flow from valleys into mountains.;LF.34b.707.1;0
1090;LF_34b;I think the water flows in that direction because the river is still trying to find the easiest route.;LF.34b.734.1;0
1091;LF_34b;Because the earth's gravitational pull.;LF.34b.753.1;0
1092;LF_34b;Because the river leads to an open delta.;LF.34b.768.1;0
1093;LF_34b;It flows in that direction because the mountain usually carries the water down the side of the mountain.;LF.34b.769.1;0
1094;LF_34b;I think the water flows in that direction because water cannot flow uphill.;LF.34b.776.1;0
1095;LF_34b;Rivers usually flow through valley. It grow weaker at the mountain because it cannot go uphill.;LF.34b.779.1;0
1096;LF_34b;There are other little streams at that end that was formed by water.;LF.34b.787.1;0
1097;LF_34b;Rivers cannot flow up mountain and valleys cannot be on mountain so it is flowing towards happy valley.;LF.34b.788.1;1
1098;LF_34b;I think that way, because the water will flow down the mountain, not up it.;LF.34b.802.1;0
1099;LF_34b;All the streams flow together forming one bigger river.;LF.34b.807.1;0
1100;LF_34b;I think this because the stream is getting wider as it goes on.;LF.34b.810.1;0
1101;LF_34b;Because that is downhill.;LF.34b.811.1;0
1102;LF_34b;I think it flows there because the river eroded the valley and the water would be flowing down the valley.;LF.34b.817.1;0
1103;LF_34b;The river gets the water from the mountain and takes it to happy valley.;LF.34b.819.1;0
1104;LF_34b;I think the water flows in the direction because that is where the crack is.;LF.34b.827.1;0

1180;LF_26a2;It is more descriptive.;LF.26a2.400.1;0
1181;LF_26a2;So you know what part of the mountain is the easiest part to climb and it has more details.;LF.26a2.404.1;0

1186;LF_26a2;To see a bird's eye view which is better view than looking from land.;LF.26a2.453.1;0
1187;LF_26a2;Because it has more and more direction to go.;LF.26a2.462.1;0
1188;LF_26a2;Because it need to walk a little be that is why I think she recommend to her.;LF.26a2.466.1;0
1189;LF_26a2;Because it would tell you where it is more steep and the elevation and the other one will not.;LF.26a2.472.1;1
1190;LF_26a2;So they can see which is steep or not and safe.;LF.26a2.474.1;0

1203;LF_26a2;She would because it has more information.;LF.26a2.585.1;0
1204;LF_26a2;They recommended it so they could see the steep parts, they are route, elevation, and shape.;LF.26a2.586.1;1

1291;LF_27a;Because it is the its spread apart.;LF.27a.405.1;0
1292;LF_27a;60 meters, Because it said the change in elevation from line A to B is 20 meters so that lets me know to count by 20 meters.;LF.27a.408.1;0
1293;LF_27a;40, Because it is 20 thought A to B and B to C.;LF.27a.421.1;1

1296;LF_27a;25 meters.;LF.27a.437.1;0
1297;LF_27a;30 meters, I measured with my fingers that C was half of B, and since B is 20 and half of that is 10 I added both of them together and got 30 meters.;LF.27a.444.1;0
1298;LF_27a;360, big the line of the A, B, C, D.;LF.27a.446.1;0
1299;LF_27a;C, Because it said the change in elevation for A and B was 20 meters and since it 20 they might be counting by 20's so that is my answer.;LF.27a.452.1;0
1300;LF_27a;40, because if it is like then to get to C just add another 20 meters.;LF.27a.462.1;1
1301;LF_27a;30, well because if A and B equals 20 meters and B true C looked like 10 more meters and I think is 30 meters.;LF.27a.468.1;0
1302;LF_27a;30, I know because A and B is 20 meters and B to C is about 10 meters and it is almost close together.;LF.27a.471.1;0
1303;LF_27a;30, because if you could change A on B so you A and C.;LF.27a.481.1;0
1304;LF_27a;40 meters, now I know is if A to B is 20 meters than A to C is 40 because you add another.;LF.27a.487.1;1
1305;LF_27a;A, they are closer to each other.;LF.27a.492.1;0
1306;LF_27a;40 meters, Because the contour numbers or lines are counting by 20 meters.;LF.27a.497.1;1
1307;LF_27a;60 meters, you are just doubling it.;LF.27a.499.1;0
1308;LF_27a;60 meters, I labeled them. I also knew C is the third letter in the alphabet so I counted by 20 3 times.;LF.27a.501.1;0

1310;LF_27a;40 meters, I know this because A to B is 20 meters and the next contour line is another 20 meters away it must be 40 meters.;LF.27a.510.1;1
1311;LF_27a;Feet, because it has a great space between.;LF.27a.512.1;0
1312;LF_27a;40 meters, I know this because the contour interval is 20 meters.;LF.27a.517.1;1

1315;LF_27a;40 meters, It is on an accurate scale.;LF.27a.676.1;0
1316;LF_27a;30, I halved what A and B was.;LF.27a.850.1;0
1317;LF_27a;40 meters, I know this because contour intervals do not change and 20 plus 20 equals 40.;LF.27a.855.1;1
1318;LF_27a;50 meters, It is double the length of B plus 10 meters.;LF.27a.856.1;0
1319;LF_27a;23 meters, I know because all you do is draw a line to line C.;LF.27a.873.1;0
1320;LF_27a;40 meters, I know because the distance between contour lines do not change.;LF.27a.906.1;1
1321;LF_27a;40, I know because the distance between every line is 20, since 20 plus 20 equals 40.;LF.27a.922.1;1
1322;LF_27a;40 meters, I know because the contour line is 20. So since A and B is 20 add 20 more.;LF.27a.937.1;1
1323;LF_6b;Because if you make them flatter it might take a while but if you make it steeper it might be easier.;LF.6b.391.1;0
1324;LF_6b;If you use a bigger hole more water come out at once like a raging river, if the slope is steeper the water will push through the earth material faster.;LF.6b.393.1;0
1325;LF_6b;Because they both are stronger, flows harder and flows faster than the rest.;LF.6b.397.1;0
1326;LF_6b;The happen when you do the experiment.;LF.6b.399.1;0
1327;LF_6b;I chose these choices because the bigger hole would work because more water would make earth material wear away faster. I think the slope flatter the water would come down really fast.;LF.6b.422.1;0
1328;LF_6b;Because there all can go steeper.;LF.6b.427.1;0
1329;LF_6b;I think these will cause more erosion because with a bigger hole more water and with the slope steeper more faster.;LF.6b.452.1;0
1330;LF_6b;Because I saw it.;LF.6b.456.1;0
1331;LF_6b;Because too much water comes and because it needs to be steeper so not much water comes.;LF.6b.462.1;0
1332;LF_6b;Because if we use a source with a bigger hole it will drop faster and makes it slope steeper.;LF.6b.477.1;0

1335;LF_6b;I chose source with a bigger hole and make the slope steeper because the hole would make the water come out more with water to make slope steeper because so the water will get more speed and to make more erosion.;LF.6b.494.1;1
1336;LF_6b;Because when you use a bigger whole the canyon is deeper and when you have a slope all the water forms a canyon.;LF.6b.497.1;0
1337;LF_6b;If you make a bigger hole then the water will be faster and erosion will too. And if you make the slope steeper then the erosion will become bigger and wider.;LF.6b.507.1;0

1339;LF_6b;I chose the ones I did because you the water to flow not slower.;LF.6b.510.1;0
1340;LF_6b;Why a bigger hole makes more erosion is because there is more water coming at once. The reason to make the slop steeper is so the water will go much faster.;LF.6b.511.1;0
1341;LF_6b;More water can cause more erosion because so much water is flowing through at a time. Also a steeper slope because the water will flow a lot faster.;LF.6b.662.1;1
1342;LF_6b;Steep slopes can have landslides, faster water can gush. To be a flood plus massively erode.;LF.6b.664.1;0
1343;LF_6b;If you use a water source with a bigger hole, more water will come out which will cause erosion. If you make the slope steeper, the water will run down faster.;LF.6b.665.1;0
1344;LF_6b;The erosion will happen faster because the flow of the water is stronger and faster so the material will be worn down more.;LF.6b.667.1;0
1345;LF_6b;I choose water source with a bigger hole because the more water the more momentum to destroy. I chose a slope because the water will travel fast.;LF.6b.673.1;1
1346;LF_6b;A bigger water hole would allow more water to come through faster. Making the slope steeper and water would run through faster.;LF.6b.688.1;0
1347;LF_6b;More water will make it faster to erode, a steeper hill will make it go faster down hill.;LF.6b.735.1;0
1348;LF_6b;Well, they change the way erosion goes faster or lower and if it slides or not.;LF.6b.738.1;0
1349;LF_6b;My house because more erosion because it is a greater mass.;LF.6b.752.1;0
1350;LF_6b;So everything would happen quicker and better.;LF.6b.768.1;0
1351;LF_6b;My choices cause more erosion because with a bigger hole more water comes out faster and when the slope is steeper the water goes down faster and very powerfully.;LF.6b.776.1;0
1352;LF_6b;My choice increases water speed and the faster something is going the more it can hold.;LF.6b.779.1;0
1353;LF_6b;Because the more water going at a faster pace because of the slopes will cause more erosion because gravity will help slope.;LF.6b.814.1;0
1354;LF_6b;If the hole is bigger that will cause a flood. More water the more velocity causing more erosion. Also if make the slope steeper that will cause the velocity to be greater causing more erosion.;LF.6b.826.1;1
1355;LF_6b;My choices cause more erosion because if you have a bigger hole more water can pour through and if the slope is steeper water will come down harder.;LF.6b.844.1;0
1356;LF_6b;They cause more erosion because there is more water flowing out the hole making a flood and when it is elevated it makes the water move faster moving more sediment.;LF.6b.853.1;1
1357;LF_6b;Making a bigger hole causes more water which makes it flow faster causing more erosion. Also having a steep slope makes water flow faster causing more erosion.;LF.6b.855.1;1

2184;ME_69b;It depends on the power of the magnets.;ME.69b.659.1;0
2185;ME_69b;Because the force field might be big enough to go through both foam blocks but it might not be.;ME.69b.661.1;1

2200;ME_69b;Magnets only have such a big magnetic field.;ME.69b.677.1;0
2201;ME_69b;Because 2 foam blocks are a lot thicker for the magnetic field to get through.;ME.69b.678.1;0

2203;ME_69b;It is too thick.;ME.69b.683.1;0
2204;ME_69b;I said the magnets will stick because magnets have really strong magnetic fields and those really strong magnetic fields so they can go through 2 foam blocks.;ME.69b.684.1;0
2205;ME_69b;I chose that answer because 2 foam blocks too much for the magnet.;ME.69b.685.1;0
2206;ME_69b;Because it is has 2 sponges.;ME.69b.686.1;0
2207;ME_69b;I chose that answer because the gap between the 2 magnets is too big.;ME.69b.687.1;0
2208;ME_69b;I chose this answer because there is too many foam blocks between the 2 magnets.;ME.69b.688.1;0
2209;ME_69b;I chose that answer because the 2 foam blocks are so thick that the magnetism cannot get through them.;ME.69b.689.1;0
2210;ME_69b;The foam blocks are thick so the magnetism will not be able to go through.;ME.69b.690.1;0

2214;ME_69b;Depends on how powerful the magnets are.;ME.69b.696.1;0
2215;ME_69b;I chose C. It might stick, but it might not because it depends on how strong the magnet is.;ME.69b.698.1;1

2365;MS_39;You might get more medicine than you needed.;MS.39.105.1;1
2366;MS_39;Because then the tallies that you use will not make sense.;MS.39.107.1;1
2367;MS_39;They use it all around the world. And it is important.;MS.39.110.1;1
2368;MS_39;If you do not use a standard unit you might not get the right answer you may not even get one that is close.;MS.39.113.1;1
2369;MS_39;Last time we were using our hand to measure the table and our hand we small and some of our kids was big.;MS.39.141.1;0
2370;MS_39;If you do not use one you and your partner will not get accurate answers.;MS.39.144.1;1
2371;MS_39;So you can find the actual answer to a question that you have.;MS.39.153.1;0
2372;MS_39;It is important to use a standard unit of measurement because if you do not it will not be correct.;MS.39.172.1;1
2373;MS_39;Because if you do not you will get the wrong measurement.;MS.39.174.1;0
2374;MS_39;Because if you do not use it you may get the wrong answer.;MS.39.190.1;1
2375;MS_39;We use standard units because if somebody makes bottles of water the put at the bottom how many liters it is.;MS.39.276.1;0
2376;MS_39;So everyone would get the same answers. It is the same for everybody.;MS.39.278.1;1
2377;MS_39;I think because if we do not use a standard unit we would get the answer wrong.;MS.39.294.1;1
2378;MS_39;Because it will help a lot. It will never change. It is the same all over the world too.;MS.39.311.1;1
2379;MS_39;You can make it too long or too short if you do not do it.;MS.39.322.1;0
2380;MS_39;So you can get the measurement the same thing as everyone else.;MS.39.347.1;0
2381;MS_39;So you can get the best answers. You need it because you will end up with 2 different answers.;MS.39.354.1;0
2382;MS_39;Because if you do not use a standard you get the answer wrong.;MS.39.381.1;1
2383;MS_39;So everybody agrees on it.;MS.39.387.1;1
2384;MS_39;Because you might not know how much it is!;MS.39.393.1;0
2385;MS_39;Because if you had no standard of measurement you could not measure anything.;MS.39.400.1;0
2386;MS_39;Because if you use paperclips that would be wrong because they come in different sizes. And if you use your hand it will also be wrong because you hand could be big or small.;MS.39.417.1;1
2387;MS_39;So you get correct measurements.;MS.39.420.1;1
2388;MS_39;Because it is better using it so you will not get it wrong.;MS.39.435.1;0
2389;MS_39;Because if you do not get the right answer. Because we are in the class. And we might in the same group in the class.;MS.39.463.1;0
2390;MS_39;Because if you do not know how many to put.;MS.39.486.1;0
2391;MS_39;Because if you do not use it will not be right.;MS.39.496.1;0
2392;MS_39;If you do not they would know if you are talking centimeters, liters, milliliters, meters, kilograms, or grams.;MS.39.499.1;1
2393;MS_39;Because you will learn metric unit faster.;MS.39.503.1;0
2394;MS_39;So others know what you mean.;MS.39.521.1;1
2395;MS_39;Well you cannot use straws.;MS.39.523.1;0
2396;MS_39;So others will know.;MS.39.532.1;0
2397;MS_39;So everybody get it right or get the same answer.;MS.39.566.1;0
2398;MS_39;So that you can make an exact and accurate measurement.;MS.39.592.1;0
2399;MS_39;Because if you used vials would be different sizes.;MS.39.595.1;0

2438;MS_14b;Because I added the 20 and the 10.;MS.14b.108.1;0
2439;MS_14b;Because it is already 30 and it is too heavy. So 20.;MS.14b.112.1;0
2440;MS_14b;I chose the answer because I needed to add it together.;MS.14b.136.1;0
2441;MS_14b;The ball is too heavy.;MS.14b.143.1;0
2442;MS_14b;I chose this answer because it could not be 30 grams because the ball is lower so it must be 40 grams.;MS.14b.146.1;1
2443;MS_14b;I chose this answer because one of the blocks said 20 grams.;MS.14b.152.1;0
2444;MS_14b;Because if you have a 20 mass piece and a 10 mass piece you have 40 grams all together.;MS.14b.171.1;0
2445;MS_14b;I counted the grams and got 30 grams.;MS.14b.174.1;0
2446;MS_14b;I got this answer because I counted 20 grams and 10 grams and it equaled 30 grams.;MS.14b.183.1;0
2447;MS_14b;Because 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams.;MS.14b.190.1;0
2448;MS_14b;I chose 20 grams because there is 20 grams plus 10 grams 30 grams that way I know how much is it.;MS.14b.276.1;0
2449;MS_14b;Because it was the cups that I saw and it was 20 grams and 10 grams to see.;MS.14b.282.1;0
2450;MS_14b;I think that is the answer 20 plus 10 equals 30.;MS.14b.291.1;0
2451;MS_14b;So I would get the right answer.;MS.14b.315.1;0
2452;MS_14b;I can see the ball is heavier than 30 grams because it is not a perfect balance and the level is not perfect.;MS.14b.319.1;1
2453;MS_14b;Because 30 is not high enough.;MS.14b.347.1;0
2454;MS_14b;I chose this answer because in the mass has 20 and 10 grams and the equals 30 grams.;MS.14b.360.1;0
2455;MS_14b;That they ball in the cup and the mass pieces are in this cup. 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30.;MS.14b.382.1;0
2456;MS_14b;I chose it because there is a 20 grams piece and a 10 grams piece but the ball is not even with the other side so it must weigh more.;MS.14b.391.1;1
2457;MS_14b;Because the mass pieces gives you the answer.;MS.14b.396.1;0
2458;MS_14b;I chose it because the mass pieces are 30 grams. So I did the highest number.;MS.14b.398.1;1
2459;MS_14b;Because it is very simple I added 20 plus 10 and it equaled 30 grams. And that is how I got my answer.;MS.14b.400.1;0
2460;MS_14b;Because in the cup there are 30 grams. So I picked 40 because 30 grams is not enough so I put 40 grams.;MS.14b.417.1;1
2461;MS_14b;Because I carried a ball before and it felt like to me it is 30 grams.;MS.14b.426.1;0
2462;MS_14b;I put answer b because 20 plus 10 equals 30.;MS.14b.452.1;0
2463;MS_14b;Because if you see it is that because I chose it.;MS.14b.463.1;0
2464;MS_14b;Because 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams.;MS.14b.488.1;0
2465;MS_14b;Because a ball is heavy, and if you put in 10 grams it will probably weight.;MS.14b.501.1;1
2466;MS_14b;20 plus 10 equals 30 and that is smaller than the ball which must be C.;MS.14b.532.1;1
2467;MS_14b;Because 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams.;MS.14b.566.1;0
2468;MS_14b;Because the ball cannot be 40 grams or 20 grams it has to be 30 grams because the ball it little.;MS.14b.569.1;0
2469;MS_14b;Because there is no standard unit.;MS.14b.592.1;0
2470;MS_14b;Because 30 grams and 20 grams is much big.;MS.14b.594.1;0
2471;MS_14b;20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams.;MS.14b.595.1;0

2532;MX_1;The sand cannot go through because the water would not let the sand dissolve.;MX.1.599.1;0
2533;MX_1;It stayed there because of its size.;MX.1.601.1;0
2534;MX_1;Because the salt evaporated so it could go through and still have salt in it. While sand did not so it could not go through.;MX.1.604.1;1
2535;MX_1;Because salt can dissolve but sand is tiny parts of the ground.;MX.1.606.1;0
2536;MX_1;Because the salt dissolved in the water and the sand did not.;MX.1.607.1;0
2537;MX_1;Because the salt is evaporated already and the sand cannot because it is hard and it is gravel.;MX.1.613.1;0
2538;MX_1;The salt became a part of the water so it dissolve in the water so the salt went with the water. But the sand did not dissolve in the water because it was so bulky.;MX.1.633.1;0
2539;MX_1;The salt dissolved and became smaller. The sand became mud and got caught together and stayed on top.;MX.1.642.1;0
2540;MX_1;They have a sticky stuff that did not work.;MX.1.649.1;0
2541;MX_22a;You can see through it.;MX.22a.385.1;0
2542;MX_22a;It is one material that dissolves into the other. Making a clear mixture. Although it could be colored, it has to be see through.;MX.22a.386.1;1
2543;MX_22a;It is a clear mixture.;MX.22a.390.1;0
2544;MX_22a;It dissolves the solid into a liquid that is see through.;MX.22a.391.1;1
2545;MX_22a;It has to be a fairly clear.;MX.22a.396.1;0
2546;MX_22a;A solution is a solid and a liquid mixed together.;MX.22a.397.1;0
2547;MX_22a;In a solution one of the materials dissolves and the mixture is see through.;MX.22a.400.1;1
2548;MX_22a;A solution is different because a solution is a mixture of a solid material and a liquid.;MX.22a.416.1;0
2549;MX_22a;Because 2 mixtures become a solution. A solution is different because mixture cannot become a solution only 2 can.;MX.22a.419.1;0
2550;MX_22a;The difference from other mixtures was that we only used 2 and other people might use 3 or 4.;MX.22a.421.1;0
2551;MX_22a;A solution is when you take a mixture like powder and mix it with water then after stirring it, it becomes a solution.;MX.22a.422.1;1
2552;MX_22a;Because it is made of 2 mixtures, and making it one mixture and becoming a solution of 2 mixtures.;MX.22a.426.1;0
2553;MX_22a;A solution is 2 materials put together and the one dissolves. And on a mixture they stay so you can see it.;MX.22a.463.1;0
2554;MX_22a;It is different because in other mixtures the liquid dissolves but in a solution the solid material dissolves.;MX.22a.466.1;1
2555;MX_22a;A solution is different from a mixture because it is when you mix 2 or more things and a solution is when like water and salt dissolves or evaporated.;MX.22a.472.1;0
2556;MX_22a;When you make solution tiny particles of the solid explained some cannot see it.;MX.22a.473.1;0
2557;MX_22a;The solid material dissolves.;MX.22a.495.1;0
2558;MX_22a;A solution is a different type of mixture. Then they are a solution is a mixtures that dissolves.;MX.22a.499.1;0
2559;MX_22a;The salt dissolved in the mixture.;MX.22a.502.1;0
2560;MX_22a;A solution something that dissolves.;MX.22a.521.1;1
2561;MX_22a;A solution is something that dissolves into the liquid and a mixture is something mixed up together.;MX.22a.527.1;1
2562;MX_22a;When the mixture is mixed.;MX.22a.528.1;0
2563;MX_22a;A solution does not dissolve.;MX.22a.530.1;0
2564;MX_22a;Other mixtures are mixed with peas and tomatoes and other foods.;MX.22a.542.1;0
2565;MX_22a;A solution is when an object disappears in the liquid and in a mixture the object does not disappear.;MX.22a.559.1;1
2566;MX_22a;A solution is something put into a liquid and made one thing.;MX.22a.562.1;0
2567;MX_22a;In a solution one material dissolves into the liquid.;MX.22a.577.1;1
2568;MX_22a;Solutions are clear.;MX.22a.595.1;0
2569;MX_22a;Clear and 2 things that make it still clear.;MX.22a.600.1;0
2570;MX_22a;A solution is different because it is clear that you can see through.;MX.22a.601.1;0
2571;MX_22a;A solution is separated but a mixture is a bunched up together.;MX.22a.604.1;0
2572;MX_22a;Because a solution is clear but other mixtures are not.;MX.22a.611.1;0
2573;MX_22a;It has and weighs more with more things in it than a solution.;MX.22a.633.1;0
2574;MX_22a;Because one of the chemicals dissolves.;MX.22a.638.1;0
2575;MX_22a;The solid must dissolve.;MX.22a.641.1;1
2576;MX_22a;They have a different type of them that they have different ideas.;MX.22a.649.1;0
2577;MX_24;Because it turns clear. It bubbles.;MX.24.384.1;0
2578;MX_24;When you can see through the solution. When the solid gets dissolved into the liquid.;MX.24.388.1;1
2579;MX_24;When you mix a solid and a liquid it is clear.;MX.24.389.1;0
2580;MX_24;Because the mixture is clear.;MX.24.390.1;0
2581;MX_24;It is clear and can be separated with evaporation.;MX.24.393.1;0
2582;MX_24;You can see through the mixture, and one material has dissolved.;MX.24.394.1;1
2583;MX_24;When one seems to disappear because it has dissolved, and you can see through it.;MX.24.400.1;1
2584;MX_24;When it creates one type of something. Like chocolate milk.;MX.24.433.1;0
2585;MX_24;It is when you cannot see the solid from the liquid.;MX.24.435.1;1
2586;MX_24;When you cannot separate them with filters or screens.;MX.24.438.1;0
2587;MX_24;The solid seems to disappear, or dissolve.;MX.24.455.1;0
2588;MX_24;Well I will see the solid at the bottom and the liquid on top of it.;MX.24.465.1;0
2589;MX_24;You know because the solid matrix I will dissolve overnight.;MX.24.466.1;0
2590;MX_24;Then material will probably split up into smaller parts.;MX.24.467.1;0
2591;MX_24;Because the solid is kind of hard and liquid is more smoother.;MX.24.469.1;0
2592;MX_24;When you cannot see the solid.;MX.24.470.1;0
2593;MX_24;The solid dissolves. The solid breaks into tiny pieces so tiny no one can see it.;MX.24.495.1;1
2594;MX_24;If you experiment you might find a way to separate.;MX.24.497.1;0
2595;MX_24;Of the materials dissolve.;MX.24.499.1;0
2596;MX_24;You know when the solid is dissolved.;MX.24.563.1;0
2597;MX_24;When water and salt mix the salt disappears or seems to and when you cannot see the salt that means you have made a solution.;MX.24.573.1;1
2598;MX_24;The solid disappears into air pockets.;MX.24.576.1;1
2599;MX_24;When something is mixing so you get a solution.;MX.24.593.1;0
2600;MX_24;You see how it mixes together and sometimes there are bubbles or wet.;MX.24.598.1;0
2601;MX_24;It is clear.;MX.24.600.1;0
2602;MX_24;I know that because it is mixed up because it is not clear anymore.;MX.24.601.1;0
2603;MX_24;When the water turns gray or a different color.;MX.24.608.1;0
2604;MX_24;Powder and water when they mix together. The water turn white, that how you tell or you look to the bottom.;MX.24.610.1;0
2605;MX_24;When they are in the container the water brushes off some dirt from the solid.;MX.24.613.1;0
2606;MX_24;When the solid dissolves.;MX.24.629.1;0
2607;MX_24;Because one of the chemicals dissolves.;MX.24.638.1;0
2608;MX_52b;Because it look a lot like alum.;MX.52b.385.1;0
2609;MX_52b;I chose it because I looked at the key below and I saw the same shape.;MX.52b.389.1;0
2610;MX_52b;Because they are the same shape.;MX.52b.391.1;0
2611;MX_52b;Because the particles in her dish, look like the ones in the box down below labeled alum.;MX.52b.396.1;1
2612;MX_52b;Because on the key alum is a hexagon and a hexagon in the middle with lines going from each point to the point on the hexagon inside.;MX.52b.400.1;1
2613;MX_52b;I chose alum because it looks like alum and the mystery solution have the same pattern.;MX.52b.416.1;0
2614;MX_52b;Because you see the picture in the dish and it looks the same.;MX.52b.431.1;0
2615;MX_52b;I looked at the crystal shape key and it looks most like alum.;MX.52b.456.1;1
2616;MX_52b;Because they look the same.;MX.52b.460.1;0
2617;MX_52b;Well I look at the key below and I saw the same way it looked at the top.;MX.52b.465.1;0
2618;MX_52b;Because that is what it is call and we talks about that is what it is call.;MX.52b.468.1;0
2619;MX_52b;Because I thought it was the best answer.;MX.52b.471.1;0
2620;MX_52b;I looked at the pictures below and one of them looked like mystery solution looked at it said alum I picked alum.;MX.52b.473.1;1
2621;MX_52b;Because crystals look like a small amount and have lines on the side something each crystal has its own shape.;MX.52b.486.1;0
2622;MX_52b;I looked at the pictures and words and I tried to see which one matched the crystals in the circle.;MX.52b.490.1;0
2623;MX_52b;Because picture tips of crystal like the same.;MX.52b.493.1;0
2624;MX_52b;Because that is the picture Emily drew. Crystals have different shapes.;MX.52b.503.1;0
2625;MX_52b;You can see it on the pictures.;MX.52b.528.1;0
2626;MX_52b;Just a wild guess.;MX.52b.533.1;0
2627;MX_52b;Because it showed what alum looks like at the bottom.;MX.52b.539.1;0
2628;MX_52b;Because they look the same.;MX.52b.556.1;0
2629;MX_52b;Because they look like they have the same properties.;MX.52b.557.1;0
2630;MX_52b;I chose that answer, because the picture look the same.;MX.52b.559.1;0
2631;MX_52b;Because picture show the exact same thing as alum in the picture below.;MX.52b.565.1;1
2632;MX_52b;Because they look the same.;MX.52b.595.1;0
2633;MX_52b;The alum has the same pattern and it looks the same.;MX.52b.600.1;0
2634;MX_52b;I chose that answer because it looks the same like the drawing in the circle.;MX.52b.601.1;0
2635;MX_52b;Because it shows the pictures below.;MX.52b.606.1;0
2636;MX_52b;I chose that answer because when I look down the picture it look the same as the picture up there.;MX.52b.611.1;0
2637;MX_52b;Because the picture down below of Epsom salt has no lines or anything.;MX.52b.612.1;0
2638;MX_52b;Because her drawing looks the same as the one in the shape key.;MX.52b.626.1;0
2639;MX_52b;The alum in the picture below is a tall hexagon the crystal in the picture above is also a tall hexagon so it led me to the conclusion that they are the same.;MX.52b.633.1;1
2640;MX_52b;Because alum looks like the picture above.;MX.52b.638.1;1
2641;MX_52b;Because it looks like alum but more crystals.;MX.52b.639.1;1
2642;MX_52b;I chose it because on the key it looks the same as the crystal evaporating dish.;MX.52b.643.1;0
2643;MX_52b;It looks closer than the other.;MX.52b.648.1;0
2644;MX_42a;The solid was too big to go through the filter paper.;MX.42a.101.1;1
2645;MX_42a;Because the little piece of the liquid and the undissolved is bigger.;MX.42a.106.1;1
2646;MX_42a;It is separate because the paper filter is liquid.;MX.42a.126.1;0
2647;MX_42a;Because the solid is too heavy to go through the paper.;MX.42a.172.1;0
2648;MX_42a;Solid is too big to go through the filter hole. Liquid is just water that can go through almost anything.;MX.42a.291.1;1
2649;MX_42a;Because the filter cannot hold the water because the filter already has water in it.;MX.42a.389.1;0
2650;MX_42a;The holes in the filter are smaller than the solid particles, and the water particles are smaller than the holes, so the water goes through the filter while the solid will not go through.;MX.42a.394.1;1
2651;MX_42a;Because the particle size was too big and the filter could not hold any more water because it was wet.;MX.42a.397.1;0
2652;MX_42a;Because when the solid touches the side, it sticks.;MX.42a.423.1;0
2653;MX_42a;Because the solid was bigger than the liquid so it got stuck!;MX.42a.432.1;1
2654;MX_42a;Because she did not wet the filter and when she put the water they got wet.;MX.42a.448.1;0
2655;MX_42a;Because the materials are too big to go through the holes but the water is not too big to go through the holes in the filter.;MX.42a.452.1;1
2656;MX_42a;It stays in the filter because the solid material does not count as the solution.;MX.42a.453.1;0
2657;MX_42a;The solid does not go through the filter like the liquid because the liquid is small enough to go through the filter but the solid is too large.;MX.42a.454.1;1
2658;MX_42a;Because it is a thick.;MX.42a.458.1;0
2659;MX_42a;Because the holes in the filter are too small for the solid to go through them.;MX.42a.462.1;1
2660;MX_42a;The solid stayed in because it was too big to go through the microscopic holes in the filter paper.;MX.42a.466.1;1
2661;MX_42a;The solid stays in the filter because the particles are too big to go through but dissolved can go through because the particles are small enough.;MX.42a.470.1;1
2662;MX_42a;It stays at the top because it is too big to go through the filter and the water is just a liquid.;MX.42a.472.1;1
2663;MX_42a;The solid is hard. It cannot go through because it is not a liquid.;MX.42a.473.1;0
2664;MX_42a;Because the solute in the saturated solution dissolved and were dispersed equally. The material that did not go through was too big to go through.;MX.42a.490.1;1
2665;MX_42a;Because the materials are stuck together with water and cannot go through the tiny holes in the filter.;MX.42a.497.1;0
2666;MX_42a;Because when the water goes through the filter some water stays which helps the filter catch the sugar.;MX.42a.502.1;0
2667;MX_42a;Because it is too thick to slide down the filter.;MX.42a.524.1;1
2668;MX_42a;Because the solid stay because it is too big and water it can just go through things like that.;MX.42a.532.1;1
2669;MX_42a;Because they are big.;MX.42a.540.1;0
2670;MX_42a;The solid stayed in because it was not as watery and it was bigger chucks. The liquid is watery and so it went through.;MX.42a.543.1;0
2671;MX_42a;The solid stays in the filter because the filter's holes are too small for the liquid to go through.;MX.42a.559.1;0
2672;MX_42a;Because paper absorbent and solids cannot go through solids.;MX.42a.562.1;0
2673;MX_42a;The liquid was too big to go through the holes.;MX.42a.563.1;0
2674;MX_42a;Because in the filter paper there are little holes!;MX.42a.567.1;1
2675;MX_42a;The solid would be too big to pass through the small holes in the filter paper.;MX.42a.568.1;1
2676;MX_42a;The solid stays because its particle size was too large to go through the filter.;MX.42a.575.1;1
2677;MX_42a;Because water goes through the paper and the salt is not water.;MX.42a.596.1;0
2678;MX_42a;Because the liquid is a substance that can go through most objects with small or tiny holes and solid cannot.;MX.42a.604.1;0
2679;MX_42a;Because the solid did not dissolve.;MX.42a.607.1;0
2680;MX_16a;No because one has more water.;MX.16a.140.1;0
2681;MX_16a;No, because they do not say how much spoons are in there and 250 milliliters is more concentrated.;MX.16a.206.1;0
2682;MX_16a;No. Because one has more water.;MX.16a.243.1;0
2683;MX_16a;No because it has to be equal.;MX.16a.277.1;0
2684;MX_16a;No, because one has more water.;MX.16a.291.1;0
2685;MX_16a;No they do not because they are not the same amount of water and it will not equal the same.;MX.16a.366.1;0
2686;MX_16a;Yes, because if you get the same amount of water from each then weighed it they would measure up to the same amount.;MX.16a.381.1;0
2687;MX_16a;No, because there is less room for the solute to spread out in Mariella's solution. The material at the bottom is not part of the solution.;MX.16a.386.1;0
2688;MX_16a;Yes because they both have the same amount of solid.;MX.16a.389.1;0
2689;MX_16a;No because they have the same solid but different amounts of water.;MX.16a.390.1;0
2690;MX_16a;Yes, the solutions have the same concentration because, using the same solute and water, there is a saturation point per milliliters of water and they have both reached the saturation point, they are saturated and cannot become any more concentrated, so they are both equally concentrated.;MX.16a.394.1;1
2691;MX_16a;No, they do not because Richard put more water which will make it less concentrated.;MX.16a.416.1;0
2692;MX_16a;No. I think that Mariella's saturated solution is more concentrated because it has more solid.;MX.16a.437.1;0
2693;MX_16a;No because one has more water which will make the solution heavier than the other.;MX.16a.453.1;0
2694;MX_16a;Yes because if they are saturated, then the stuff on bottom went to waste and the waters are holding the same number of water and solid except for the stuff on the bottom. Take that stuff out then they both have the same concentration.;MX.16a.463.1;1
2695;MX_16a;No, because the 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because it has less solvent and 250 milliliters of water has more solvent.;MX.16a.464.1;0
2696;MX_16a;No because if you had Kool-aid the one with more water will give the powder more space to dissolve, but the one with less water will saturate because there is less space for the powder to dissolve.;MX.16a.466.1;0
2697;MX_16a;Yes because they both cannot hold any more solid.;MX.16a.488.1;1
2698;MX_16a;Yes. They are both saturated which means they are also concentrated.;MX.16a.494.1;0
2699;MX_16a;No. Why because one has 3 spoons of salt in it and 2 has 4 spoons of salt in it that is why it is more solution.;MX.16a.528.1;0
2700;MX_16a;No, because it might be a different amount of the solid in it.;MX.16a.557.1;0
2701;MX_16a;I think yes because it does not matter how much whatever you put in it and they put the same amount of stuff.;MX.16a.564.1;0
2702;MX_16a;Yes, because if you take out the same amount of water out of each solution and put them on a balance then they will weigh the same. Only a certain amount of water can hold a certain amount of salt.;MX.16a.566.1;0
2703;MX_16a;No it does not because the 250 is more than 100.;MX.16a.572.1;0
2704;MX_16a;Yes because if you take out a certain amount of water out of each of them and weigh them and they will weigh the same.;MX.16a.573.1;0
2705;MX_16a;No, the one with 100 milliliters of water is more concentrated because the solid has less room.;MX.16a.576.1;0
2706;MX_16a;No because Richard has more water than Mariella and Mariella only has 100 milliliters of water. And it is more crowded with 100 milliliters of water.;MX.16a.584.1;0
2707;MX_16a;No, because Richard has more concentration space than Mariella because he has more water which means less saturation room.;MX.16a.592.1;0
2708;MX_16a;Yes, because they are both saturated and if they add more it will just become more saturated.;MX.16a.597.1;0
2709;MX_16a;Yes. Because they both put sort of the same amount of water into the cup and so they both have the same concentration.;MX.16a.598.1;0
2710;MX_16a;No, because Mariella's solution had more water.;MX.16a.601.1;0
2711;MX_16a;Yes there is the same amount of solution.;MX.16a.606.1;0
2712;MX_16a;No, because if they did then both the water would be the same.;MX.16a.611.1;0
2713;MX_16a;No because Richard has way more solution than Mariella so it is not the same amount.;MX.16a.644.1;0
2714;MX_46b;B has more solute than A does therefore B will weigh more since the solute is equally spread.;MX.46b.386.1;0
2715;MX_46b;They are the same amount of water different in spoons. That is why B weighs more because of spoons.;MX.46b.391.1;0
2716;MX_46b;Because you would have to take 50 milliliters of water out of cup B or else cup B would be heavier. So it would more fair.;MX.46b.425.1;0
2717;MX_46b;I chose cup A because it seems more concentrated.;MX.46b.429.1;0
2718;MX_46b;Because he pour only 50 milliliters of solution in each cup.;MX.46b.437.1;0
2719;MX_46b;Because B is the double of A.;MX.46b.439.1;0
2720;MX_46b;Because cup B has more spoons of the solute and has more water.;MX.46b.457.1;0
2721;MX_46b;Because if you just took 50 milliliters of water out of each, they would be equal. I got this one wrong.;MX.46b.464.1;0
2722;MX_46b;I think the second one because B has more scoops of solute.;MX.46b.466.1;0
2723;MX_46b;Because now there is now only some of water in each and 4 is more than 2 and cup B more concentration.;MX.46b.467.1;0
2724;MX_46b;I picked cup B because I thought it would have more spoons of solute than cup A.;MX.46b.471.1;0
2725;MX_46b;I pick this one because if you split solution B into 2 water levels it will be 50 so if A is 50 and 2 spoons the other one is going to have to have 2 spoons too because the other one is double.;MX.46b.472.1;1
2726;MX_46b;Because 2 is half of 4 spoons and 50 milliliters is half of 100.;MX.46b.488.1;1
2727;MX_46b;Because Nigel took out the same amount of solutions. There is 2 spoons for 50 milliliters of water. The concentration are the same.;MX.46b.493.1;1
2728;MX_46b;They both have 2 spoonfuls per 50 milliliters so when you compare 50 milliliters from each they both have 2 spoonfuls in the 50 milliliters.;MX.46b.495.1;1
2729;MX_46b;Because they both have the same amount of water but have different amount of salt.;MX.46b.499.1;0
2730;MX_46b;I think cup B would be more heavy because cup B is more concentrated.;MX.46b.502.1;0
2731;MX_46b;They are going to be even.;MX.46b.524.1;0
2732;MX_46b;Cup B is more concentrated than cup A.;MX.46b.528.1;0
2733;MX_46b;Because solution B has more water in the top.;MX.46b.540.1;0
2734;MX_46b;Because if he takes 50 milliliters out of A and puts it back in A it is still the same and if he takes 50 milliliters out of B and puts it back in then they are still both the same.;MX.46b.542.1;1
2735;MX_46b;They are the same, because there is a pattern, for every 2 spoons of solute add 50 milliliters of water.;MX.46b.559.1;1
2736;MX_46b;B because it gave 100 milliliters water and 4 spoons of solute. And A gave 5 milliliters water 2 spoon of salt so I stay with B.;MX.46b.561.1;0
2737;MX_46b;I chose the same because he took bottle A and half of bottle B and half of bottle B equals A.;MX.46b.563.1;1
2738;MX_46b;It is like x like 50 times 2 equals 100 so then 2 spoons of solute equals 50.;MX.46b.570.1;0
2739;MX_46b;All solutions are mixtures, and a solution is when something disappears into the other.;MX.46b.575.1;0
2740;MX_46b;Solution would need to be doubled.;MX.46b.595.1;0
2741;MX_46b;Because he took the same amount from each bottle.;MX.46b.597.1;0
2742;MX_46b;Because they both have the same amount of solution in each cup. So both cups weigh the same.;MX.46b.598.1;0
2743;MX_46b;Because there is 2 spoons and 50 milliliters and then there is 4 spoons and 100 milliliters so they are going to weigh the same.;MX.46b.605.1;1
2744;MX_46b;Because there is more water and solute.;MX.46b.608.1;0
2745;MX_46b;I chose that one because in bottle B they took 50 milliliters but in it they put 4 spoons.;MX.46b.612.1;0
2746;MX_46b;I chose this one because in the picture above there is more water in cup B.;MX.46b.630.1;0
2747;MX_46b;Solution B has more water so it weighs more than solution A.;MX.46b.640.1;0
2748;MX_46b;Cup B because it is just double.;MX.46b.643.1;0
2749;MX_47b;If you take the same amount of water and weight it will measure to the same things.;MX.47b.381.1;1
2750;MX_47b;I chose cup 2 because it has the same water 2 has more solute.;MX.47b.385.1;0
2751;MX_47b;The solutions have the same amount of solute, there is just more on the bottom of the cup in cup 2.;MX.47b.386.1;1
2752;MX_47b;I chose A because in each cup you could put 4 spoons and it dissolved. When the fifth scoop went in it did not dissolve. The undissolved part is not part of the solution.;MX.47b.388.1;1
2753;MX_47b;Once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.;MX.47b.418.1;0
2754;MX_47b;My choice is A because it might weigh the same and they both is saturated.;MX.47b.421.1;1
2755;MX_47b;Because both of the cups one and 2 have the same amount of concentrations because they are both saturated.;MX.47b.422.1;1
2756;MX_47b;They are the same because once a solution is saturated it cannot go further.;MX.47b.423.1;1
2757;MX_47b;I chose cup 2 because it has more solute in it.;MX.47b.425.1;0
2758;MX_47b;I picked C because cup 2 has more solute than cup one.;MX.47b.426.1;0
2759;MX_47b;Because it has more spoons of solute but it has the same amount of water.;MX.47b.434.1;0
2760;MX_47b;Because there is the same amount of solvent but there is more solute in cup 2.;MX.47b.453.1;0
2761;MX_47b;Each solution has same amount of water, which means they both hold the same amount of solute after saturation.;MX.47b.455.1;1
2762;MX_47b;Because they are both at the highest point of concentration.;MX.47b.457.1;1
2763;MX_47b;Because it is the same.;MX.47b.460.1;0
2764;MX_47b;It does not show how much dissolved and how much did not.;MX.47b.462.1;0
2765;MX_47b;Because both cup one and 2 are already concentrated. Neither cup one or 2 can hold any more solvent.;MX.47b.488.1;0
2766;MX_47b;Because Tabby said that the solute and water were the same and I believe him and it says that they both have the same thing on the bottom clear, material on the bottom.;MX.47b.498.1;0
2767;MX_47b;It clearly states that 2 has more.;MX.47b.504.1;0
2768;MX_47b;Because is look like it.;MX.47b.524.1;0
2769;MX_47b;Same water but more scoops.;MX.47b.531.1;0
2770;MX_47b;Because both looked alike to me.;MX.47b.532.1;0
2771;MX_47b;Because cup 2 have 8 spoons.;MX.47b.540.1;0
2772;MX_47b;I think that the answer is cup 2 because it has more spoons.;MX.47b.541.1;0
2773;MX_47b;Because solution 2 is more concentrate because it has more spoonfuls.;MX.47b.556.1;0
2774;MX_47b;I put C because cup 2 has more spoons of solute so it would be heavier.;MX.47b.563.1;0
2775;MX_47b;Because cup 2 has more salt, 8 spoons and because it has more material on the bottom.;MX.47b.567.1;0
2776;MX_47b;I put A because it is the same because it the same amount of water and only 2 scoops more than the other one.;MX.47b.571.1;0
2777;MX_47b;I would need to know how much stuff is at the bottom.;MX.47b.595.1;0
2778;MX_47b;Because they have the same amount of water but cup 2 has more spoons of solute.;MX.47b.597.1;0
2779;MX_47b;Both have the same because they have the same milliliters of water and they are both the same.;MX.47b.598.1;0
2780;MX_47b;Cup one might have 6 spoons of solute and cup 2 has 8 spoons and both have 50 milliliters of water.;MX.47b.604.1;0
2781;MX_47b;Cup one has less material on the bottom.;MX.47b.635.1;0
2782;MX_47b;Because cup one has the same amount of water but different amount of solute.;MX.47b.638.1;0
2783;MX_47b;The solutions both have the same amount of water, but not the same amount of clear material on the bottom. So cup one wins.;MX.47b.640.1;0
2784;MX_47b;Because both are saturated, and if you used 6 spoons for cup 2 both cups are still saturated.;MX.47b.641.1;1
2785;MX_10;Jorge knew a chemical reaction was occurred because it started bubble.;MX.10.387.1;0
2786;MX_10;Because the mixture bubbled.;MX.10.390.1;0
2787;MX_10;Because gas being formed can be a sign of a chemical reaction.;MX.10.396.1;1
2788;MX_10;Because he knew the bubbles meant carbon dioxide was being formed.;MX.10.400.1;1
2789;MX_10;Because the balloon expanded and filled with gas and it bubbled up.;MX.10.419.1;1
2790;MX_10;Because it started to bubble or to fizz and it is the proof of gas.;MX.10.421.1;1
2791;MX_10;Because when it bubbles that means a reaction is taking place.;MX.10.423.1;0
2792;MX_10;Because bubbling is a sign of a chemical reaction.;MX.10.425.1;0
2793;MX_10;Because it bubbled.;MX.10.429.1;0
2794;MX_10;Because the solution began to bubble.;MX.10.434.1;0
2795;MX_10;Because whenever it fizzes or bubbles that means it is a reaction.;MX.10.435.1;0
2796;MX_10;Because the bubbles appear it makes a gas.;MX.10.436.1;1
2797;MX_10;He knew because there are bubbles in the container.;MX.10.453.1;0
2798;MX_10;Bubble.;MX.10.458.1;0
2799;MX_10;Because gas bubbles appeared.;MX.10.462.1;1
2800;MX_10;He knew because first he put a material in the water and started to bubble and that made gas so that is a clue of a chemical reaction.;MX.10.463.1;1
2801;MX_10;Because there were gas bubbles.;MX.10.466.1;1
2802;MX_10;Because he saw it bubble up that is why he knew it was a chemical reaction.;MX.10.468.1;0
2803;MX_10;When he put the solid in the liquid it start to bubbles.;MX.10.492.1;0
2804;MX_10;Because it bubbled and fizz.;MX.10.493.1;0
2805;MX_10;Because it bubbled and when something bubbled it means a reaction occurred.;MX.10.498.1;0
2806;MX_10;Because the solution bubbled.;MX.10.502.1;0
2807;MX_10;I think it is because it started to bubble and because it would not do that if it was not a reaction.;MX.10.532.1;0
2808;MX_10;He knew because it bubbled.;MX.10.541.1;0
2809;MX_10;Jorge knew a chemical reaction occurred, because the mixture began to bubble.;MX.10.543.1;0
2810;MX_10;He knew because a change occurred and it made a gas.;MX.10.568.1;1
2811;MX_10;He knew because when bubbles pop a gas is released into the air.;MX.10.575.1;1
2812;MX_10;Because it was making gas, it was fizzing, it made some precipitant.;MX.10.576.1;1
2813;MX_10;Because the solution started to bubble.;MX.10.597.1;0
2814;MX_10;Because the container started to bubble up.;MX.10.604.1;0
2815;MX_10;Because he saw it fizz and bubble up.;MX.10.605.1;0
2816;MX_10;Because bubble appeared when he add the solid material.;MX.10.611.1;0
2817;MX_10;Because it bubbled and if it bubbles then it is a reaction.;MX.10.612.1;0
2818;MX_10;A chemical reaction is when something happens if you add a material and a liquid together and something happens it is a chemical reaction.;MX.10.633.1;0
2819;MX_10;Because it started to bubble and have a gas.;MX.10.638.1;1
2820;MX_10;Because his experiment took action right away with no waiting.;MX.10.644.1;0
2821;MX_18;It dissolved in the water.;MX.18.106.1;0
2822;MX_18;The chemical that stayed down there.;MX.18.119.1;0
2823;MX_18;The chemical that saturated down there.;MX.18.146.1;0
2824;MX_18;That is not a solution it is a mixture.;MX.18.151.1;0
2825;MX_18;It creates a precipitate a new chemical who you mix 2 different chemicals and that creates a precipitate.;MX.18.219.1;0
2826;MX_18;The white solid indicates by being a mixture.;MX.18.248.1;0
2827;MX_18;The white solid indicates that the white solid went to the bottom.;MX.18.255.1;0
2828;MX_18;A solution.;MX.18.277.1;0
2829;MX_18;To evaporate.;MX.18.283.1;0
2830;MX_18;The material that you put in the water did not dissolve because it is too heavy.;MX.18.291.1;0
2831;MX_18;The white solid had settles and so the 2 solutions would be a mixture.;MX.18.364.1;0
2832;MX_18;All of the thing that you put in will go to the bottom leaving a clear liquid.;MX.18.366.1;0
2833;MX_18;There is a precipitate on the bottom.;MX.18.381.1;0
2834;MX_18;It is a product on the bottom of the cap.;MX.18.387.1;0
2835;MX_18;Well when you mix the 2 solutions it became a different mixture.;MX.18.422.1;0
2836;MX_18;That it is a new solid material.;MX.18.426.1;0
2837;MX_18;Chemical reaction.;MX.18.428.1;1
2838;MX_18;A chemical reaction.;MX.18.439.1;1
2839;MX_18;It indicates a precipitate.;MX.18.453.1;0
2840;MX_18;That white solid indicates a precipitate.;MX.18.456.1;0
2841;MX_18;It saturated in the cup.;MX.18.458.1;0
2842;MX_18;That it is a precipitate because if they mixed materials, together and there was a cherry and there is a new material then that is a precipitate.;MX.18.463.1;0
2843;MX_18;Because that one that you are say that you are so to 46 that or no.;MX.18.468.1;0
2844;MX_18;That the water cannot hold any more solute. It is saturated.;MX.18.490.1;0
2845;MX_18;That the white solid is C.;MX.18.492.1;0
2846;MX_18;A new product that is called a precipitate.;MX.18.493.1;0
2847;MX_18;That you have made a saturated solution.;MX.18.496.1;0
2848;MX_18;The white solid indicates that a precipitate has occurred.;MX.18.503.1;0
2849;MX_18;A precipitant.;MX.18.504.1;0
2850;MX_18;Salt.;MX.18.542.1;0
2851;MX_18;It was solution and a mixture. It promptly got cold or hot at the bottom.;MX.18.572.1;0
2852;MX_18;Saturation.;MX.18.601.1;0
2853;MX_18;The white solid indicates the crystals.;MX.18.636.1;0
2854;MX_18;It indicates that it turned into a solution and mixture that got mixed then produced chemical also.;MX.18.639.1;1
2855;MX_18;We kept on glassing because it become clear.;MX.18.996.1;0
2856;MX_19;Because when it fizzing it releases a gas. When a gas forms from 2 materials it is a gas.;MX.19.387.1;0
2857;MX_19;Because the baking soda and citric acid started out plain but when you poured water in it reacted.;MX.19.390.1;0
2858;MX_19;Because it shows and once you see it you will know that it is a chemical reaction because it starts to look like little bubbles and that is what a chemical reaction is.;MX.19.392.1;0
2859;MX_19;Because it indicates something else is produced.;MX.19.423.1;1
2860;MX_19;Because the chemicals clash and fizz.;MX.19.425.1;0
2861;MX_19;Because It means that it is a gas or new material!;MX.19.426.1;1
2862;MX_19;It created a gas and new material was made.;MX.19.432.1;1
2863;MX_19;Because the 2 solutes and the solvent made a gas.;MX.19.438.1;0
2864;MX_19;It indicates a gas.;MX.19.439.1;1
2865;MX_19;Because the bubble makes the solution or mixture different.;MX.19.453.1;0
2866;MX_19;Because it was letting out gas.;MX.19.454.1;0
2867;MX_19;Gas was in it so that why it start fizzing.;MX.19.459.1;0
2868;MX_19;It is a clue because it is making a gas and that is a clue so you know that a chemical reaction is about to happen.;MX.19.463.1;1
2869;MX_19;Because you made a gas.;MX.19.464.1;0
2870;MX_19;Because a chemical reaction creates gas bubbles or a precipitate.;MX.19.467.1;1
2871;MX_19;It was fizzing because when he a mix baking soda and citric acid together the fizzing have meant that it dissolved and made bubbles.;MX.19.469.1;0
2872;MX_19;Because it shows that something other than just doing nothing.;MX.19.473.1;0
2873;MX_19;Because something has to happen for the precipitate to be made.;MX.19.487.1;1
2874;MX_19;Because fizzing is created by gas bubbles.;MX.19.492.1;0
2875;MX_19;Because fizzing is a sign of gas leaving a material and that is a chemical reaction.;MX.19.494.1;1
2876;MX_19;Because when it does that you know that you have made gasses and gasses are made when chemical reactions occur.;MX.19.496.1;1
2877;MX_19;Fizzing is a reaction.;MX.19.500.1;0
2878;MX_19;Sometimes because fizzing means that gas is escaping and that is a chemical reaction.;MX.19.501.1;1
2879;MX_19;Because if it was just water it would not fizz.;MX.19.502.1;0
2880;MX_19;Because when it fizzes there is gas and that is a sign of a chemical reaction.;MX.19.560.1;1
2881;MX_19;It is evidence because it made gas and fizzing occurs only when one material does not like the other one.;MX.19.563.1;1
2882;MX_19;Fizzing evidence of a chemical reaction because when it fizzes it means it is producing gas.;MX.19.564.1;1
2883;MX_19;It is a chemical reaction because it made a gas and a gas only appears if there is a chemical reaction.;MX.19.575.1;1
2884;MX_19;Something happened so it is a reaction.;MX.19.595.1;0
2885;MX_19;Because fizzing is a reaction and so it had to be a chemical reaction.;MX.19.597.1;0
2886;MX_19;Because you are putting 2 mixtures together so when it starts fizzing that is how you know it is a chemical reaction.;MX.19.604.1;0
2887;MX_19;Because it did something.;MX.19.605.1;0
2888;MX_19;Because it fizzed and moved so that is how.;MX.19.608.1;0
2889;MX_19;Because it is bubbling and bubbling is a reaction when you mix stuff together and it bubbles.;MX.19.612.1;0
2890;MX_19;Because when more than 2 chemicals are mixed it produces fizzing.;MX.19.626.1;0
2891;MX_19;Because the material before did not use to fizz until they were put together.;MX.19.635.1;0
2892;MX_36a;Because first she put eggshells then the next day she made a solution.;MX.36a.136.1;0
2893;MX_36a;Because bubble came out of the eggshell.;MX.36a.146.1;0
2894;MX_36a;I think she made a solution because the eggshells and bubbles disappeared.;MX.36a.151.1;1
2895;MX_36a;She made a solution because she said that the water was clear and that is a solution.;MX.36a.185.1;1
2896;MX_36a;I think she did a solution because it had bubbles.;MX.36a.248.1;0
2897;MX_36a;Because the eggshells were gone.;MX.36a.261.1;1
2898;MX_36a;Because it was clear.;MX.36a.285.1;0
2899;MX_36a;That is because a solution is clear that you could see through.;MX.36a.304.1;0
2900;MX_36a;She made a solution because the eggshells had disappeared and it cannot be separated.;MX.36a.359.1;1
2901;MX_36a;Because the eggshells were gone and the water was left, inside was clear that why she thinks that she made a solution.;MX.36a.364.1;1
2902;MX_36a;It was a reaction because it fizz and bubble up.;MX.36a.385.1;0
2903;MX_36a;The mixture was clear and eggshell was gone.;MX.36a.392.1;1
2904;MX_36a;Because bubbles are one sign of a gas.;MX.36a.393.1;0
2905;MX_36a;She thinks she made a solution because the eggshell dissolved in the vinegar and bubbled up and turned clear.;MX.36a.419.1;1
2906;MX_36a;Because the eggshell was gone and it was clear.;MX.36a.432.1;1
2907;MX_36a;Grace mixed 2 materials together and the solution ended up clear.;MX.36a.437.1;0
2908;MX_36a;Because she thinks that the eggshells and the water reaction and she think during the reaction the eggshell dissolved.;MX.36a.439.1;0
2909;MX_36a;She thinks she made a solution because the solute dissolved and the water is clear.;MX.36a.453.1;1
2910;MX_36a;Grace thinks she made a solution because first she put eggshells into a cup and covered them up with vinegar and then small bubbles appeared on the surface of the eggshell and a couple of days the eggshells were gone and the liquid was clear.;MX.36a.469.1;1
2911;MX_36a;Yes because she saw the gas on and the vinegar was clear.;MX.36a.473.1;0
2912;MX_36a;Because a solution is when a solute and a solvent are mixed and she did that.;MX.36a.496.1;0
2913;MX_36a;Because she put eggshells in a cup and covered them with vinegar and after a couple of days she saw that they were gone.;MX.36a.503.1;1
2914;MX_36a;The eggshells dissolved a solution is when the solvent dissolve.;MX.36a.504.1;0
2915;MX_36a;The vinegar destroyed the eggshells.;MX.36a.531.1;0
2916;MX_36a;Because he used something that can make it bubble.;MX.36a.540.1;0
2917;MX_36a;I think Grace thinks she made a solution because she mixed eggshells and vinegar together.;MX.36a.543.1;0
2918;MX_36a;Because at the end the eggshell was gone and the water was clear.;MX.36a.562.1;1
2919;MX_36a;Grace thinks she made a solution because the eggshells disappeared into the liquid.;MX.36a.568.1;1
2920;MX_36a;I think the reason why Grace thinks she made a solution is because the eggshells went away after awhile.;MX.36a.571.1;1
2921;MX_36a;I think she did make a solution because a solution is when 2 or more materials are mixed together and one disappears into the other.;MX.36a.572.1;1
2922;MX_36a;Because it turned into a clear liquid solution.;MX.36a.576.1;0
2923;MX_36a;She thinks the water was clear, which it was so it was a solution.;MX.36a.592.1;0
2924;MX_36a;Because there were more bubbles everyday.;MX.36a.596.1;0
2925;MX_36a;Because she said the water was clear. When water is clear then it is a solution.;MX.36a.601.1;1
2926;MX_36a;It is a solution because the eggshells disappeared leaving liquid clear making a solution.;MX.36a.626.1;1
2927;MX_36a;Because she mixed the vinegar with the eggshells and later bubbles started to show up then it cleared.;MX.36a.635.1;1
2928;MX_36b;Because after a while small bubbles appeared, but in the next day, bubbles, starting to be more eggshells were disappeared.;MX.36b.136.1;1
2929;MX_36b;She made a reaction because it started to bubble after a while.;MX.36b.151.1;1
2930;MX_36b;She made a reaction because bubbles appeared.;MX.36b.181.1;1
2931;MX_36b;She did make a reaction by saying that there was bubbles in the cup.;MX.36b.185.1;1
2932;MX_36b;The eggshells were gone.;MX.36b.261.1;0
2933;MX_36b;Grace thinks she made a reaction because bubbles appeared on the eggshells and that is what a reaction is.;MX.36b.267.1;1
2934;MX_36b;Because there are bubbles and the shells just disappeared.;MX.36b.282.1;1
2935;MX_36b;There was bubbles but just there was a gas.;MX.36b.381.1;0
2936;MX_36b;Because it was bubbles and fizzing.;MX.36b.387.1;1
2937;MX_36b;Because it started bubble.;MX.36b.389.1;1
2938;MX_36b;Because the eggshells bubbled then dissolved.;MX.36b.425.1;1
2939;MX_36b;Because it bubbled.;MX.36b.430.1;1
2940;MX_36b;Bubbles on the eggshells.;MX.36b.431.1;1
2941;MX_36b;Because there were bubbles.;MX.36b.433.1;0
2942;MX_36b;Because there was bubbles.;MX.36b.436.1;1
2943;MX_36b;The bubbles made a reaction.;MX.36b.437.1;1
2944;MX_36b;Because there were gas bubbles.;MX.36b.462.1;1
2945;MX_36b;Because she use eggshells and vinegar then small bubbles appeared then there were more bubbles the eggshells turned into a liquid.;MX.36b.469.1;1
2946;MX_36b;Because a reaction is where something combines and changes start which is a fizz or bubbles.;MX.36b.486.1;1
2947;MX_36b;Because there were a lot of bubbles. That one of the effects of a reaction.;MX.36b.488.1;1
2948;MX_36b;Because there were gas bubbles.;MX.36b.490.1;1
2949;MX_36b;It was a slow reaction but when it started to bubble and the shell dissolved it was a reaction.;MX.36b.494.1;1
2950;MX_36b;Because there was a lot of bubbles on the eggshell after she added the vinegar.;MX.36b.495.1;1
2951;MX_36b;Because she saw bubbles.;MX.36b.497.1;1
2952;MX_36b;Because she put eggshells in a cup and covered them with vinegar and after a couple of days she saw that they were gone.;MX.36b.503.1;0
2953;MX_36b;A few bubbles came. Gas.;MX.36b.504.1;1
2954;MX_36b;Because the egg shells disappeared.;MX.36b.525.1;0
2955;MX_36b;She made bubbles and that is a common sign of a reaction.;MX.36b.537.1;1
2956;MX_36b;Because she mix more there was fizz.;MX.36b.556.1;0
2957;MX_36b;Because there were more bubbles everyday.;MX.36b.596.1;1
2958;MX_36b;Because the eggshells bubbled and a few days later the eggshells were gone.;MX.36b.597.1;1
2959;MX_36b;She did make a reaction because she saw bubbles.;MX.36b.601.1;1
2960;MX_36b;Because it bubbled.;MX.36b.607.1;1
2961;MX_36b;Because it was gone.;MX.36b.609.1;0
2962;MX_36b;Because it had bubbles appearing.;MX.36b.611.1;1
2963;MX_36b;It bubbled that is why.;MX.36b.612.1;1
2964;MX_41;No because no solid that one has more than the other in the same amount of water.;MX.41.387.1;0
2965;MX_41;No not all mixtures and solutions come out correct he needs to let it sit or he should let or he should let I stir it.;MX.41.392.1;0
2966;MX_41;Yes because different materials have different solubility.;MX.41.393.1;1
2967;MX_41;Yes because different solids have different solubility is. Janet and Mike used different solids. They are wrong.;MX.41.396.1;1
2968;MX_41;Yes it is possible both solubility's are correct different solubility's very possible because some substances are more able to dissolve in less space than others.;MX.41.399.1;1
2969;MX_41;Yes because the water has different materials in it and the materials have different atoms and stuff and that makes changes to what happens to them in water and their solubility.;MX.41.400.1;1
2970;MX_41;No because it has 2 different chemicals and it does not have the same solubilities.;MX.41.421.1;0
2971;MX_41;Yes because they are whole new materials.;MX.41.423.1;1
2972;MX_41;Because they are different ingredients.;MX.41.424.1;1
2973;MX_41;Yes because they are 2 different ingredients.;MX.41.430.1;1
2974;MX_41;Yes because the solubility is of mixtures are not all the same.;MX.41.434.1;1
2975;MX_41;Yes because they are different materials.;MX.41.436.1;1
2976;MX_41;Yes because they are both different.;MX.41.439.1;1
2977;MX_41;Yes it is.;MX.41.458.1;0
2978;MX_41;What do you mean I do not how what you are say to me so can you help me.;MX.41.468.1;0
2979;MX_41;Yes because all material move in a different way.;MX.41.486.1;1
2980;MX_41;Because they are different things. Nitrate is different then chloride so they cannot be the same weight. Just like a monkey and a elephant.;MX.41.496.1;0
2981;MX_41;Yes because all materials have different grams.;MX.41.503.1;0
2982;MX_41;Yes because they are 2 different things.;MX.41.525.1;1
2983;MX_41;No because silver chloride is different than silver nitrate.;MX.41.541.1;0
2984;MX_41;No because silver chloride is different than silver nitrate.;MX.41.542.1;0
2985;MX_41;They are correct because the materials are 2 whole different materials.;MX.41.563.1;1
2986;MX_41;Yes because something else can have the exact same thing and it does not have to be like that.;MX.41.564.1;0
2987;MX_41;No because only a certain amount of solid can dissolve in a certain amount of water. They both got different solubility in the same amount of water which mean somebody did something wrong.;MX.41.566.1;0
2988;MX_41;The fizzing means that it came from the gas.;MX.41.572.1;0
2989;MX_41;Yes they can do it different but be the same way.;MX.41.593.1;0
2990;MX_41;No because they are different grams.;MX.41.596.1;0
2991;MX_41;No because they might weigh different.;MX.41.604.1;0
2992;MX_41;Yes because Janet used silver chloride and Mike used silver nitrate which means if they used 2 different things they both could be right.;MX.41.607.1;1
2993;MX_41;Yes because both the silver thing are different and they weigh different.;MX.41.611.1;0
2994;MX_41;No because they used different chemicals so that why it is not the same and also because they used different sizes.;MX.41.613.1;0
2995;MX_41;It could be possible chance it is correct but there could also be a 50 chance it is right and a 50 50 chance it is wrong. If they do not know they could do some test and research.;MX.41.639.1;0
2996;MX_41;Yes because silver nitrate might be heavier.;MX.41.643.1;0
2997;MX_11a;Because when you use a mixture and as it dissolve it is a solution.;MX.11a.106.1;1
2998;MX_11a;Maybe it could change to him and have something die.;MX.11a.119.1;0
2999;MX_11a;I think jam is mixture.;MX.11a.126.1;0
3000;MX_11a;Because they dissolved.;MX.11a.151.1;1
3001;MX_11a;When the mixture is clear and no material is on the bottom.;MX.11a.176.1;1
3002;MX_11a;The evidence Jim has is the material on the bottom and the solid because a solution has 2 or more things combined.;MX.11a.267.1;0
3003;MX_11a;That the water is clear.;MX.11a.282.1;1
3004;MX_11a;My evidence is a solution can be clear or evaporated by heat and so all of them are clear.;MX.11a.304.1;1
3005;MX_11a;The evidence he has is that it is clear and nothing on bottom to be a solution.;MX.11a.356.1;1
3006;MX_11a;Because it was clear and nothing on the bottom.;MX.11a.390.1;1
3007;MX_11a;He put the solid in the water and the solid dissolved into the water.;MX.11a.391.1;1
3008;MX_11a;Mixtures one, 3, and possibly 2 are clear a sign that the material has dissolved and made a solution.;MX.11a.399.1;1
3009;MX_11a;Mixtures one and 2 are solutions because they are clear.;MX.11a.418.1;1
3010;MX_11a;It has to be clear with nothing on bottom.;MX.11a.424.1;1
3011;MX_11a;When the solid material is disappeared.;MX.11a.426.1;1
3012;MX_11a;I know it is a solid because it has stuff in the but mine.;MX.11a.431.1;0
3013;MX_11a;That there is undissolved particle at the bottom.;MX.11a.432.1;0
3014;MX_11a;Mixtures 4 and 5 are evidence.;MX.11a.434.1;0
3015;MX_11a;Because a solution is clear.;MX.11a.438.1;1
3016;MX_11a;He has that he put a solute in the solvent and it came out clear and nothing on bottom.;MX.11a.463.1;1
3017;MX_11a;His evidence is the mixture turned clear.;MX.11a.473.1;1
3018;MX_11a;If the material dissolved it is a solution.;MX.11a.487.1;1
3019;MX_11a;Because the solid dissolve.;MX.11a.492.1;1
3020;MX_11a;The evidence is the water cannot take any more ingredients.;MX.11a.493.1;0
3021;MX_11a;Because there is nothing at the bottom.;MX.11a.496.1;1
3022;MX_11a;That if it does have material at the bottom that it is not.;MX.11a.498.1;1
3023;MX_11a;Because the solid dissolve.;MX.11a.499.1;1
3024;MX_11a;There is material on the bottom and that means it is saturated solution.;MX.11a.501.1;1
3025;MX_11a;Because some of them have a dissolved solid.;MX.11a.503.1;1
3026;MX_11a;The mixtures are clear.;MX.11a.525.1;1
3027;MX_11a;How much water is in it, and how much spoons of solid are in it.;MX.11a.567.1;0
3028;MX_11a;When the solid disappears into the solvent.;MX.11a.569.1;1
3029;MX_11a;His mixture is clear.;MX.11a.595.1;1
3030;MX_11a;One spoon.;MX.11a.599.1;0
3031;MX_11a;He does not have an idea that island make a salt outline.;MX.11a.602.1;0
3032;MX_11c;Greater than because mixture 5 has the same amount of water with more spoons of solid.;MX.11c.101.1;0
3033;MX_11c;Greater than because it have 5 spoon of clear material.;MX.11c.113.1;0
3034;MX_11c;Mixture 5 because they have the same amount of water but mixture 5 has more spoon.;MX.11c.151.1;0
3035;MX_11c;Greater than mixture 4.;MX.11c.243.1;0
3036;MX_11c;It is the same because it has the same stuff at the bottom.;MX.11c.255.1;0
3037;MX_11c;The same because in the picture of mixture 4 and 5, they show the same salt on the bottom.;MX.11c.347.1;1
3038;MX_11c;They are the same and equal concentrated.;MX.11c.364.1;0
3039;MX_11c;Mixtures is the same concentration, because both of the mixtures are saturated.;MX.11c.381.1;1
3040;MX_11c;It is greater than because mixture 4 has more room to dissolve than mixture 5.;MX.11c.384.1;0
3041;MX_11c;The same, because both solutions have the same saturation point so they have the same concentration and amount of solid.;MX.11c.386.1;1
3042;MX_11c;The same because they both reached the saturation point.;MX.11c.390.1;1
3043;MX_11c;They are the same amount concentrated because they have the same amount of water and dissolved material.;MX.11c.399.1;1
3044;MX_11c;It is greater than because they have the same amount of water but 5 has one more spoon than 4.;MX.11c.416.1;0
3045;MX_11c;They are the same because once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.;MX.11c.418.1;1
3046;MX_11c;The same because once a solution is saturated it is at its highest level of concentration.;MX.11c.423.1;1
3047;MX_11c;The concentration is more in 5 because it has more material in it.;MX.11c.425.1;0
3048;MX_11c;Greater than.;MX.11c.432.1;0
3049;MX_11c;They are the same because when a solution is saturated, it is at its highest point of concentration.;MX.11c.433.1;1
3050;MX_11c;They are the same because when the solution is saturated it is at its highest point of concentration.;MX.11c.439.1;1
3051;MX_11c;The same because both solutions are saturated.;MX.11c.456.1;1
3052;MX_11c;No because 5 has more scoops than 4.;MX.11c.460.1;0
3053;MX_11c;Same because if they all have the same water and 4 is concentrated with 4 scoops and 5 with 5 scoops then the solubility is the same because of the same amount of water become crystal.;MX.11c.463.1;1
3054;MX_11c;Same as mixture 4 because you cannot see them.;MX.11c.465.1;0
3055;MX_11c;Mixture 5 is greater than mixture 4 because it has the same amount of water and at the bottom it is both clear material but it does not have the same amount of solid.;MX.11c.469.1;0
3056;MX_11c;No because there is one extra spoon in 5.;MX.11c.502.1;0
3057;MX_11c;Same because they are both saturated and it can only hold an equal amount.;MX.11c.531.1;1
3058;MX_11c;Greater than because it has more scoops.;MX.11c.533.1;0
3059;MX_11c;The same because it has the same amount of water.;MX.11c.557.1;0
3060;MX_11c;Same. Because they are both saturated.;MX.11c.560.1;1
3061;MX_11c;The same because they both have the same amount of water.;MX.11c.572.1;0
3062;MX_11c;The same because once a solution is saturated it is at its greatest concentration.;MX.11c.575.1;0
3063;MX_11c;One, 2, 3 they all are clear with no material on the bottom.;MX.11c.626.1;0
3064;MX_11c;They both have material on the bottom.;MX.11c.633.1;1
3065;MX_11c;Same they both are clear and there is material on bottom.;MX.11c.635.1;1
3066;MX_11c;It is greater than because it has one more spoon of the solid.;MX.11c.636.1;0
3067;MX_11e;He could use a paper filter decided what he is using or a screen.;MX.11e.143.1;0
3068;MX_11e;He could get a filter and pour the solution into to it with a cup under.;MX.11e.176.1;0
3069;MX_11e;Jim could separate dissolved water by using a filter. The water turns clear.;MX.11e.248.1;0
3070;MX_11e;Let it evaporate.;MX.11e.261.1;0
3071;MX_11e;Get a filter paper and pour the dissolve mixture and the solid will stay in the filter.;MX.11e.347.1;0
3072;MX_11e;The solid will maybe dry up and water will stay the same.;MX.11e.364.1;0
3073;MX_11e;It dissolves and weigh 100 milliliters still.;MX.11e.366.1;0
3074;MX_11e;Jim could evaporate the solution. The water would go into the air and turn into a gas but the salt would stay behind.;MX.11e.393.1;0
3075;MX_11e;He can evaporate mixture one. The water would become a gas and some kind of crystal would be left.;MX.11e.396.1;0
3076;MX_11e;He could filter it and the solid could be in the filter and the water could be in the cup.;MX.11e.419.1;0
3077;MX_11e;He could put in a evaporation tray and see the solid material!;MX.11e.426.1;1
3078;MX_11e;Evaporate the water so there is just the solid.;MX.11e.432.1;0
3079;MX_11e;He could evaporate the solution, the water would evaporate and the solid will be left behind.;MX.11e.438.1;0
3080;MX_11e;It could evaporate the water from the salt. The solid crystallized and the water turned into a gas called water vapor.;MX.11e.452.1;0
3081;MX_11e;Pour the solution into evaporating dishes. The water evaporates, or turns into a gas, and the solid crystallizes.;MX.11e.455.1;1
3082;MX_11e;He could evaporate the solution and the water would be in the air and the solid would be in the container.;MX.11e.457.1;0
3083;MX_11e;It dissolves into the air bubble.;MX.11e.459.1;0
3084;MX_11e;Evaporate. The solid would crystallize, and the water would become vapor and go into the clouds.;MX.11e.464.1;0
3085;MX_11e;Put the solution in an evaporation plate and let it dissolve.;MX.11e.467.1;0
3086;MX_11e;You can get a coffee filter you pour it in the you wait for it to seep into the coffee filter.;MX.11e.468.1;0
3087;MX_11e;Jim could use a coffee filter to separate the solid from the water. Now the water and the solid are separated.;MX.11e.471.1;0
3088;MX_11e;Jim could evaporate the solution.;MX.11e.491.1;0
3089;MX_11e;He could filter out the dissolved with a dry filter. And the water will be in its own cup.;MX.11e.496.1;0
3090;MX_11e;He could filter out the solid. Or evaporate the water.;MX.11e.497.1;0
3091;MX_11e;Evaporate the solute. The water dissolves and the solute will turn into crystals.;MX.11e.502.1;0
3092;MX_11e;You could let the water evaporate and there will probably be something left over in the dish or cup.;MX.11e.527.1;0
3093;MX_11e;He can use a filter.;MX.11e.541.1;0
3094;MX_11e;He could take a filter, 2 cups, and put one under the filter paper and pour it through. So the solid would end up in the filter and the water in the cup.;MX.11e.564.1;0
3095;MX_11e;Jim could put the solution in an evaporation dish and the solid will be the crystals and the water will evaporate.;MX.11e.566.1;1
3096;MX_11e;First he could take a wet filter paper, put a clear cup with nothing in it underneath it, then pour the solution through the filter paper.;MX.11e.574.1;0
3097;MX_11e;Jim could pour the water onto a plate and have the water evaporate and the solid will crystallize.;MX.11e.592.1;1
3098;MX_11e;You could not do it.;MX.11e.605.1;0
3099;MX_11e;Use a filter to separate the. The solid will stay in filter and water will just go through.;MX.11e.635.1;0

3101;MX_11e;He could put it through a filter and then he would be able to see the crystals.;MX.11e.640.1;0
3102;MX_11f;There would be a clear liquid with no solid on the bottom.;MX.11f.101.1;0
3103;MX_11f;It is going to be clear at the bottom and you will not see anything and I know this because if it does not dissolve in mixture it will not dissolve.;MX.11f.106.1;1
3104;MX_11f;It has been a little different.;MX.11f.119.1;0
3105;MX_11f;Clear, mixture 3 is clear.;MX.11f.172.1;0
3106;MX_11f;He would observe that the water is not saturated yet because a mixture 4 it get saturated.;MX.11f.176.1;1
3107;MX_11f;It would be a solution. One and 3 have either one spoon or 2 spoons of solid in their mixtures and they are still a solution.;MX.11f.190.1;0
3108;MX_11f;He would observe nothing you need more spoons to make it saturated. Because mixture 3 has 3 spoons and it is not saturated.;MX.11f.219.1;1
3109;MX_11f;He would observe the nothing will be at the bottom.;MX.11f.234.1;0
3110;MX_11f;He would not observe anything because nothing happened to the other ones either.;MX.11f.282.1;0
3111;MX_11f;It will dissolve in the cup.;MX.11f.366.1;0
3112;MX_11f;Clear and nothing on the bottom because one scoop and 100 milliliters of water has the same results and so does mixture 3, 3 spoons and 100 milliliters water.;MX.11f.388.1;1
3113;MX_11f;Clear, nothing on bottom because mixture one and 3 are that.;MX.11f.390.1;1
3114;MX_11f;Clear with nothing on the bottom. Evidence Mixture 3 has more and is clear with nothing on the bottom and mix.;MX.11f.391.1;1
3115;MX_11f;I think that the mixture would be clear with nothing on the bottom, because both mixture one and 3 say that if mixture 3 is not saturated and has more material than 2, 2 would not be saturated either.;MX.11f.396.1;0
3116;MX_11f;It would not have any particles at the bottom.;MX.11f.421.1;1
3117;MX_11f;That the solid dissolved in the solute! That with one spoon. It is clear and with 3 spoons it is clear so the solid will dissolve in the solute!;MX.11f.426.1;1
3118;MX_11f;If mixture 3 is dissolved, and mixture one is not dissolved. Mixture 2 will not be dissolved because it is less concentrated than mixture 3.;MX.11f.433.1;0
3119;MX_11f;He will see clear and nothing in the bottom because you cannot see nothing in 3.;MX.11f.439.1;1
3120;MX_11f;It would dissolve because he has so much water there would be enough space to dissolve the solid.;MX.11f.452.1;0
3121;MX_11f;Well if solution 3 has more materials and it is dissolved the evidence he would have is solution 2 will be dissolved too.;MX.11f.453.1;0
3122;MX_11f;That the solid dissolves because one, 3 dissolves.;MX.11f.465.1;0
3123;MX_11f;It would dissolve because 100 milliliters of water gives the solid more room to dissolve.;MX.11f.466.1;0
3124;MX_11f;The solid would dissolve because so did solution one and 3.;MX.11f.467.1;0
3125;MX_11f;When he put the 2 spoons in the 50 milliliters in of water he will get 2 times for water then mixture.;MX.11f.468.1;0
3126;MX_11f;2 spoons of solid and 100 milliliters of water and it was clear material on the bottom.;MX.11f.469.1;0
3127;MX_11f;That there is one dg. one spoon is 5 grams.;MX.11f.471.1;0
3128;MX_11f;It would look clear and who have nothing on the bottom.;MX.11f.486.1;0
3129;MX_11f;Well It would be clear because 2 has more solid and is still clear.;MX.11f.494.1;0
3130;MX_11f;I think he would see the solid dissolve.;MX.11f.557.1;0
3131;MX_11f;Mixture 2 maybe clear with nothing on the bottom.;MX.11f.562.1;0
3132;MX_11f;He would observe the solution clear and nothing at the bottom because one and 3 do not have anything at the bottom and if 3 does not have any solute at the bottom 2 would not either.;MX.11f.566.1;1
3133;MX_11f;He would observe fizzing in the cups. To evidence this you would put a lot of things in both of the cups.;MX.11f.572.1;0
3134;MX_11f;Nothing will be on the bottom and it will be clear. Because solution 3 has nothing on the bottom and it is clear.;MX.11f.597.1;1
3135;MX_11f;There would be no material of bottom because mixtures does not have any material on bottom.;MX.11f.636.1;0
3136;MX_49;Y, y because it have to be less.;MX.49.113.1;0
3137;MX_49;X, I chose x because x is more concentrated.;MX.49.128.1;0
3138;MX_49;X, well concentration is when you compare equal amount of volume of 2 solutions and one heavier it is more concentrated so that is how I know.;MX.49.140.1;1
3139;MX_49;Y, y has less material on bottom.;MX.49.143.1;0
3140;MX_49;X, they have the same amount of water but cup x has more citric acid.;MX.49.151.1;0
3141;MX_49;X, I know because when something is more concentrated it is also heavier.;MX.49.181.1;0
3142;MX_49;X, cup x is more heavier.;MX.49.214.1;0
3143;MX_49;X, because x is more heavier than cup y.;MX.49.228.1;0
3144;MX_49;X, because is heavier then y.;MX.49.248.1;0
3145;MX_49;X, cup x because it has more sugar in it.;MX.49.255.1;0
3146;MX_49;X, x because it is heavier.;MX.49.261.1;0
3147;MX_49;X, I know cup x is more concentrated because on the balance cup x is heavier and cup y is less concentrated.;MX.49.267.1;1
3148;MX_49;X, how I know is because concentrated means the heaviest.;MX.49.304.1;0
3149;MX_49;X, I know because when a solution has more solid, has a better taste, or weighs more it is more concentrated than the other one.;MX.49.356.1;0
3150;MX_49;X, x has less room to move around and y has less room to move around.;MX.49.381.1;0
3151;MX_49;X, I know that solution x is more concentrated.;MX.49.389.1;0
3152;MX_49;X, Because it weighed more than cup y.;MX.49.390.1;0
3153;MX_49;X, It is lighter.;MX.49.391.1;0
3154;MX_49;Y, is more concentrated because cup x is on the floor and that is not good, right?;MX.49.419.1;0
3155;MX_49;X, because it have more solid in it and it is heavier.;MX.49.421.1;0
3156;MX_49;X, because it is heavier.;MX.49.423.1;0
3157;MX_49;X, Because cup x is more heavier!;MX.49.426.1;0
3158;MX_49;X, the more concentrated is cup x is heavier.;MX.49.431.1;0
3159;MX_49;X, because the material gave it weight.;MX.49.437.1;0
3160;MX_49;X, well on a balance is on the bottom and if it can lift the other solution it is more concentrated.;MX.49.453.1;0
3161;MX_49;X, Cup x must have been more concentrated because it is heavier.;MX.49.455.1;0
3162;MX_49;X, usually the heaviest cup on the balance is the most concentrated cup.;MX.49.502.1;0
3163;MX_49;X, I think it is because it heavier. Remember I said I think.;MX.49.527.1;0
3164;MX_49;X, it is heavier.;MX.49.528.1;0
3165;MX_49;X, because it seem more concentrated then y.;MX.49.532.1;0
3166;MX_49;X, cup x because it is more heavy.;MX.49.541.1;1
3167;MX_49;X, I know cup x is the most concentrated because it weighs the most.;MX.49.566.1;0
3168;MX_49;X, I know solution x is more concentrated because it is heavier than solution y.;MX.49.569.1;0
3169;MX_49;X, They added more solute into the solution x than solution y. That is why solution x is heavier.;MX.49.577.1;0
3170;MX_49;X, because x is on the bottom of the weighing thing while y is on the top.;MX.49.613.1;1
3171;MX_49;X, because cup x weighs more than cup y.;MX.49.642.1;0
3172;MX_53;He could see what solid used and he will find out what it is.;MX.53.106.1;0
3173;MX_53;He should look for the solid material in his house or store.;MX.53.113.1;0
3174;MX_53;You can tell by the way the crystals are shaped.;MX.53.157.1;1
3175;MX_53;He can probably look in a book or something to find out. All crystals are different.;MX.53.181.1;0
3176;MX_53;The crystals help him by making solid materials.;MX.53.248.1;0
3177;MX_53;Salt.;MX.53.261.1;0
3178;MX_53;To see if it was Epsom salt, salt, citric acid or calcium chloride.;MX.53.282.1;0
3179;MX_53;I going to put salt and water and leave it for some days and it is going to turn into crystals.;MX.53.347.1;0
3180;MX_53;If you put citric acid the crystals will be like a influx.;MX.53.366.1;0
3181;MX_53;I think it will help be by the shape and what has on it.;MX.53.384.1;1
3182;MX_53;How they look like x means salt.;MX.53.385.1;1
3183;MX_53;Since different materials have different crystals, like salt is a x, then you can figure out what material has the same characteristic shape as the crystal that were from that particular solution, then he knows what material was used.;MX.53.400.1;1
3184;MX_53;Because by the markings and patterns on the crystals your all to identify them.;MX.53.418.1;0
3185;MX_53;Because no 2 crystals are the same.;MX.53.423.1;0
3186;MX_53;Because a crystal identifies the solute!;MX.53.426.1;0
3187;MX_53;He could check the crystals with a magnifying glass.;MX.53.435.1;0
3188;MX_53;If he has a chart he can just match to whichever one it looks like.;MX.53.436.1;1
3189;MX_53;He can mate the crystals to the solid material.;MX.53.438.1;0
3190;MX_53;He would look up that type of crystal in a book and find out what type it is.;MX.53.454.1;0
3191;MX_53;He could match the crystals with other crystals.;MX.53.457.1;0
3192;MX_53;Show them the crystals.;MX.53.458.1;0
3193;MX_53;The crystals might have salt in them.;MX.53.461.1;0
3194;MX_53;He could compare the crystals to other crystals.;MX.53.497.1;0
3195;MX_53;Whatever the crystals look most like.;MX.53.525.1;1
3196;MX_53;He can compare them with other crystals he can make and that will tell him.;MX.53.560.1;0
3197;MX_53;The crystals can identify what solid was used in the solution by its shape.;MX.53.566.1;1
3198;MX_53;He will know because he will see stuff at the bottom.;MX.53.572.1;0
3199;MX_53;You can use your own mixtures and see what it looks like.;MX.53.592.1;0
3200;MX_53;Use all the salt then wait for them to evaporate but in the other trays name them by the salt so he would know which one is which but then there done he can see which one looks like that one.;MX.53.613.1;1
3201;MX_53;Because all solid has different crystals.;MX.53.630.1;0
3202;MX_53;Take other crystals and compare to see which ones are kind of the same.;MX.53.635.1;0
3203;MX_53;How the crystals were shaped and how they looked.;MX.53.637.1;1
3204;MX_53;He can look at them really hard and compare them with others.;MX.53.643.1;1
3205;MX_53;Adam can try to make crystals and if the solution he used makes crystals then that is the same solution his friend used.;MX.53.644.1;0
3206;PS_2a;Because it is sticky!;PS.2a.104.1;0
3207;PS_2a;Because it hits the other side.;PS.2a.107.1;0
3208;PS_2a;Because vibration.;PS.2a.110.1;1

3494;PS_12;Because she can be know that the vibration travel in the water.;PS.12.600.1;0
3495;PS_12;I think it helped because when you see it you can see it vibrates.;PS.12.602.1;0
3496;PS_12;When the water splashed vibration caused it and that is what cause the sound too.;PS.12.610.1;1
3497;PS_12;That helps because of the vibrations.;PS.12.626.1;0
3498;PS_12;It makes a sound in the water and you know that it makes a sound because the sound vibrates the water and where there is sound there is vibration.;PS.12.629.1;0

3599;PS_15bp;It makes the lowest sound because it is bigger and vibrates slower.;PS.15bp.532.1;1
3600;PS_15bp;This is why it makes the lower sound the one I circled goes down and then up that might be why.;PS.15bp.539.1;0
3601;PS_15bp;I think that is the correct answer because is bigger.;PS.15bp.562.1;1
3602;PS_15bp;Because it is a big one so it is going to make the lowest sound.;PS.15bp.567.1;1

3609;PS_26p;No because it is not true you do not have to move a bottle to make a sound.;PS.26p.104.1;0
3610;PS_26p;No Because it can travel from air.;PS.26p.107.1;0
3611;PS_26p;Yes. Because it has vibrations to cause.;PS.26p.138.1;1
3612;PS_26p;Yes I agree with her, because when it moves it makes vibrations and that is what helps to make sound and when it is not moving it is not making sound.;PS.26p.142.1;1
3613;PS_26p;Yes I agree with Kate because it has to vibrate.;PS.26p.160.1;1
3614;PS_26p;Yes because it needs to vibration.;PS.26p.171.1;1
3615;PS_26p;Yes I do agree with Kate. Example: when the wind blows really hard it makes a sound.;PS.26p.179.1;0
3616;PS_26p;I do because sounds can not be made without vibrations.;PS.26p.183.1;1
3617;PS_26p;I do not agree because object does not have to move all the time.;PS.26p.192.1;0
3618;PS_26p;I do agree it has to vibrate to make sound and vibrating is considered moving.;PS.26p.212.1;1
3619;PS_26p;Yes because vibration is a type of movement and sound is made by vibration.;PS.26p.221.1;1
3620;PS_26p;Yes because it has to move to make vibrations which make sound.;PS.26p.228.1;1
3621;PS_26p;Yes because it has to vibrate to make sounds.;PS.26p.252.1;1
3622;PS_26p;Yes. Because vibration is movement and to create vibration the object has to move to create sound.;PS.26p.255.1;1
3623;PS_26p;No because if you jump on a sofa the string will move and make noise.;PS.26p.313.1;0
3624;PS_26p;Yes because vibrations has to move.;PS.26p.323.1;1
3625;PS_26p;No because desks do not move.;PS.26p.332.1;0
3626;PS_26p;Yes because how can it make a sound if it does not vibrate.;PS.26p.384.1;1
3627;PS_26p;I agree with her because when an object moves it causes vibration and vibration causes sound.;PS.26p.391.1;1
3628;PS_26p;I agree with her because the object has to vibrate.;PS.26p.400.1;1
3629;PS_26p;I agree with her because vibrations make sounds and vibration moves.;PS.26p.461.1;1
3630;PS_26p;I agree with her because when you talk, your vocal cords moves and when you hear a sound, the things that made that sound must move and vibrate.;PS.26p.468.1;1
3631;PS_26p;Yes because it need to vibrate.;PS.26p.488.1;1
3632;PS_26p;Yes. When you move something it causes vibrations. And the vibrations cause sound waves.;PS.26p.499.1;1
3633;PS_26p;Yes, because sound has to vibrate it.;PS.26p.504.1;0
3634;PS_26p;YES. I think yes because it changes the sound.;PS.26p.510.1;0
3635;PS_26p;I agree with Kate because vibration creates sound, without vibration there would be no sound.;PS.26p.528.1;1
3636;PS_26p;Yes, I agree with her. In order to make sound, it needs to move.;PS.26p.533.1;0
3637;PS_26p;I agree because if you move paper it produces a sound.;PS.26p.557.1;0
3638;PS_26p;I agree because it has to vibrate.;PS.26p.563.1;1
3639;PS_26p;Yes because if you do not move it will not make sound.;PS.26p.571.1;0
3640;PS_26p;I do agree with her because if a sound is made it vibrates and vibration is back and forth movement and without vibration you can not make a sound.;PS.26p.599.1;1
3641;PS_26p;Yes I do agree. Because an object has to move to make vibration which makes sound.;PS.26p.610.1;1
3642;PS_26p;I agree with her. Because if an object makes a sound it has to vibrate.;PS.26p.626.1;1
3643;PS_26p;I do agree with her because a object has to move to make a sound.;PS.26p.641.1;0
3644;PS_46b;Because so it can tell people to get out of the way in case of a fire.;PS.46b.101.1;1
3645;PS_46b;Because for the sound.;PS.46b.107.1;0
3646;PS_46b;Because when a house is on fire the fire people turn on their sirens.;PS.46b.114.1;0
3647;PS_46b;Would by a sound. Because it was high and low enough for someone to hear.;PS.46b.118.1;1
3648;PS_46b;So people can hear.;PS.46b.145.1;1
3649;PS_46b;Because if someone called 911 they could hear that they are coming.;PS.46b.154.1;1
3650;PS_46b;So when people in cars are driving it tells them to get out of the way.;PS.46b.171.1;1
3651;PS_46b;So everyone can hear it.;PS.46b.181.1;1
3652;PS_46b;Because the fire alarm would when a house is on fire.;PS.46b.184.1;0
3653;PS_46b;So people would move if it was an emergency.;PS.46b.212.1;1
3654;PS_46b;So if people heard this high pitch they would know to move or get out of the way.;PS.46b.222.1;1
3655;PS_46b;So people would know to get out of the way.;PS.46b.225.1;1
3656;PS_46b;Because it is a big pitch.;PS.46b.253.1;0
3657;PS_46b;So people know there is an emergency.;PS.46b.255.1;1
3658;PS_46b;Because high pitch is louder. So everyone can hear it because there is a fire.;PS.46b.263.1;1
3659;PS_46b;It gets cars out of the way. So they can get to the fire faster.;PS.46b.319.1;1
3660;PS_46b;I think siren.;PS.46b.323.1;0
3661;PS_46b;So people know to move.;PS.46b.391.1;1

4079;SE_51b;It is not the shape that makes the difference, it is the area.;SE.51b.132.1;0
4080;SE_51b;Because it has the same amount of water and heat.;SE.51b.164.1;0

4088;SE_51b;I chose less than because X is a little bit more smaller.;SE.51b.331.1;0
4089;SE_51b;Because water really does not change very much.;SE.51b.339.1;0
4090;SE_51b;Same, because they are the same size triangles and in the same size boxes, with the same amount of water.;SE.51b.388.1;1
4091;SE_51b;I think the temperature will stay the same because they are the same shapes.;SE.51b.389.1;1

4098;SE_51b;I think X and Y's temperature would be the same because it is the same just flipped.;SE.51b.441.1;1
4099;SE_51b;It would be the same because for it to be greater than or less than it depends where you put the solar water heater.;SE.51b.487.1;0
4100;SE_51b;It would be greater than because the cover on X is bigger than the one on Y.;SE.51b.490.1;0
4101;SE_51b;I think it would be the same because there is no change in variables.;SE.51b.492.1;1

4118;SE_25a;A. I knew dry soil was B because it lets in heat fast and lets it go fast, so dry soil is not a good heat sink.;SE.25a.313.1;0
4119;SE_25a;A. Because A was the higher than the other one because it is hot inside because dry not wet.;SE.25a.320.1;0
4120;SE_25a;A. Because container A has a higher temperature and dry soil does not contain water so the temperature is going to be high.;SE.25a.324.1;0
4121;SE_25a;A. Because water is the best heat sink and heat sinks absorb solar energy slowly and release it slowly. Dry soil is a heat sink too, but is not the best.;SE.25a.331.1;1
4122;SE_25a;A. B because dry soil is not that high than the water one.;SE.25a.332.1;0
4123;SE_25a;B. because A has the highest temperature and B has the lowest.;SE.25a.336.1;0

4125;SE_25a;A. Because soil heats up faster.;SE.25a.394.1;0
4126;SE_25a;A. The graph helped me by showing the temperature. The dry soil is darker with no heat sink material like water to slow the absorption of heat.;SE.25a.441.1;0

4128;SE_25a;A. Because dry soil heats more in the sun.;SE.25a.506.1;0
4129;SE_25a;A. The graph helped me decide which container had the dry soil because I know that water is a heat sink and I know that heat sinks bring in heat slower and lets it out slow.;SE.25a.508.1;1
4130;SE_25a;A. Had wet soil it takes a longer time for it to heat up. So the dry soil would heat up faster.;SE.25a.513.1;0
4131;SE_25a;B. The graph helped me because dry soil is not a heat sink like water so it does not absorb the heat as fast.;SE.25a.514.1;0

4134;SE_25a;A. Because dry soil absorbs solar energy faster because it is not a heat sink.;SE.25a.529.1;0
4135;SE_25a;A. Because water is a heat sink so it heats up slowly and soil heats up quickly.;SE.25a.530.1;0
4136;SE_25a;A. Because it heats up faster.;SE.25a.532.1;0
4137;SE_25a;A. The graph help me because I know that dry soil is black which perhaps it will get hotter unlike the water it reflects the sun's energy.;SE.25a.539.1;0
4138;SE_25a;A. Water makes things cooler so the dry soil gets hotter.;SE.25a.576.1;0
4139;SE_25a;A. I know that container A had the dry soil because dry soil heats up the fastest in the sun and goes down in the shade.;SE.25a.596.1;0
4140;SE_25a;B. The graph helped me decide which container had dry soil because I know that water is a better heat sink and wet soil has water in it.;SE.25a.597.1;0
4141;SE_25a;A. A was the highest because dry soil heats faster.;SE.25a.598.1;0
4142;SE_25a;A. Container A had dry soil because non wet materials or dry materials will heat up faster than wet materials because wet materials are heat sinks and they take longer to absorb and release heat.;SE.25a.604.1;1
4143;SE_25a;A. Dry soil is A because dry soil is a earth material and absorbs the sun's energy more than B.;SE.25a.611.1;0
4144;SE_25a;A. It helped me because container A has the highest temperature than container B.;SE.25a.614.1;0
4145;SE_25a;A. Water is a heat sink and will heat up slow but there is no water in dry soil so it heats up fast.;SE.25a.615.1;0
4146;SE_31b;A. Because it is larger. B is very skinny.;SE.31b.105.1;1
4147;SE_31b;A. Box A got hotter because the temperature in the graph helped me decide.;SE.31b.118.1;1
4148;SE_31b;A. Her box got the hottest so it had to be A. It had to be A because it was laying down and the sun could get in it more faster than David's.;SE.31b.126.1;1
4149;SE_31b;A. The results help me find this out.;SE.31b.129.1;0
4150;SE_31b;A. Julie's box had more black so the box was hotter because the more black the more the heat the black absorb. So that is why I chose Julie's because in my graph hers was the highest.;SE.31b.139.1;1
4151;SE_31b;A. I looked at the chart.;SE.31b.150.1;0
4152;SE_31b;A. It has higher results and her box is long and of course skinny.;SE.31b.160.1;1
4153;SE_31b;A. Solar water heater A was painted more black so that one got hotter.;SE.31b.191.1;1
4154;SE_31b;Both. They are both have the same centimeters but A is down and B is up so A and B are the same but different.;SE.31b.250.1;0
4155;SE_31b;A. The box had a bigger black spot to hold and attract more heat.;SE.31b.257.1;1
4156;SE_31b;A. Because more heat would go into the small box than the long big box.;SE.31b.258.1;1
4157;SE_31b;A. I think Julie is A because when first temperature. I did her first so I think she is A.;SE.31b.265.1;0
4158;SE_31b;B. Because Julie's has bigger numbers in the chart and letter B looks bigger but with the same amount of everything.;SE.31b.314.1;0
4159;SE_31b;A. A because black is shown more on the bottom and so the black absorbed the heat.;SE.31b.315.1;1
4160;SE_31b;B. Because his temperature is more taller than David because they are different by how they are.;SE.31b.320.1;0
4161;SE_31b;B. Because B is more taller and it has a smaller top and it is not that extended like A. A is a transfer rate of heat. B preserves more solar energy.;SE.31b.331.1;0
4162;SE_31b;A. Water can heat up faster in a wide tank because the water is not deep. Julie has the hottest degree Celsius.;SE.31b.393.1;0
4163;SE_31b;A. Box A is laid horizontally. The sun is hitting mostly the top. Box A has a bigger top than box B. Thus making box A hotter.;SE.31b.405.1;1
4164;SE_31b;A. A is set flat down on the ground spreading the water around and it has a larger black space which will absorb more heat heating the water faster.;SE.31b.406.1;1
4165;SE_31b;A. I choose A because it heated up faster and was spread out so it heated up faster.;SE.31b.407.1;1
4166;SE_31b;A. Since more of hers were on the ground on something dark it would absorb more heat because dark colors absorb more heat.;SE.31b.430.1;1
4167;SE_31b;A. The evidence that supports my answer is A box because with a long section colored black, the solar heater would absorb more heat and the temperature under Julie's name because the temperature is hotter than David's.;SE.31b.443.1;1
4168;SE_31b;A. Because her box got the highest temperature. And it had more room to heat it up.;SE.31b.492.1;1
4169;SE_31b;A. The evidence that supports my answer is that box A had more black in it and the sun would absorb box A more.;SE.31b.494.1;1
4170;SE_31b;A. I picked A because the inside had more black space.;SE.31b.521.1;1
4171;SE_31b;A. Because there is more black tarp and under Julie it has higher temperatures. And more black heats up faster so Julie's is A.;SE.31b.525.1;1
4172;SE_31b;A. Because the solar energy meets the collector sooner because it is shorter, so it heats up quicker.;SE.31b.529.1;0
4173;SE_31b;A. Julie's temperature went higher than David because she has more square units of solar collectors.;SE.31b.531.1;1
4174;SE_31b;A. Well the more area black covers the hotter it will get. Just like in the table. Since A covers more I thought that A would be a perfect match with the table.;SE.31b.536.1;1
4175;SE_31b;A. Because the more black tarp you have, the hotter it is going to get.;SE.31b.548.1;1
4176;SE_31b;A. Because the bigger box heats up fast and Julie's temperatures were high.;SE.31b.574.1;1
4177;SE_31b;A. Because she had higher temperatures than David.;SE.31b.594.1;1
4178;SE_31b;A. The evidence that supports my answer is the chart or table. I looked at both the temperatures and solar water heaters and I decide, using the chart or table, that A is Julie's.;SE.31b.597.1;1
4179;SE_31b;A. Julie made box A because her temperatures were high. Box A has more black than box B. So box A will absorb more heat since it has more black.;SE.31b.608.1;1
4180;SE_31b;A. It is box A because the box has more black than the other box and it absorbs the sun is heat.;SE.31b.610.1;1
4181;SE_31b;A. A because it has more black painted than in box B so A absorbs more than B.;SE.31b.611.1;1
4182;SE_45;I think that Betty was a best shadow that was facing the opposite direction.;SE.45.114.1;0
4183;SE_45;The reason why this happened is because the sun revolves around the earth.;SE.45.123.1;0

4185;SE_45;In the morning the sun faced east so the bus sign's shadow was in the west. When it was the afternoon, the sun faced west. So the shadow went the opposite of where it used to be in the morning.;SE.45.139.1;1
4186;SE_45;Since the earth spins, the sun twirls around us. In the morning it was hitting the bus sign in the back. Then later the shadow seems to have moved. It is because of the position of the sun.;SE.45.140.1;0
4187;SE_45;Because the earth run into the sun and made the bus shadow go around.;SE.45.146.1;0
4188;SE_45;If the sun is in the east the shadow is on the west. If the shadow is on the south then the shadow is on the north.;SE.45.150.1;0
4189;SE_45;The sun is in different places at different times.;SE.45.165.1;0
4190;SE_45;This happens because in the morning the sun rises north that is why the bus points in the street. The bus points the opposite direction, because the sun sets west.;SE.45.182.1;0
4191;SE_45;Because the time changes so the shadow is at the opposite.;SE.45.250.1;0
4192;SE_45;This happen because the sun moved over the sky.;SE.45.261.1;0
4193;SE_45;In the morning the sun rises from the east, and the bus blocked the light and made a shadow on the opposite direction.;SE.45.313.1;0
4194;SE_45;Because the sun orbits the earth and it goes from east to west and it gets shorter.;SE.45.338.1;0
4195;SE_45;The sun rises in the east so the shadow was on the west and the sun sets in the west so the shadow was on the east.;SE.45.383.1;1
4196;SE_45;Because over time the sun goes to the west moving the shadow.;SE.45.386.1;0
4197;SE_45;Because the sun moves. So the shadow will change where it is.;SE.45.387.1;0
4198;SE_45;Because the sun moves around. So it will shine the opposite direction.;SE.45.394.1;0
4199;SE_45;Because the sun sets in the opposite direction. So what happens is the shadow will be on the opposite side.;SE.45.401.1;0
4200;SE_45;The earth rotates making the sun in different spots causing the shadows to move in different spots.;SE.45.434.1;0

4204;SE_45;The earth orbits around the sun so the shadow will change.;SE.45.499.1;0
4205;SE_45;This happens because the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, therefore the sun's light is hitting the stop sign at different positions.;SE.45.515.1;0
4206;SE_45;Because our earth rotates.;SE.45.518.1;0
4207;SE_45;This happens because of the earth, it rotates around the sun which of course the shadows will move, also the sun rises in the east and sets on the west.;SE.45.539.1;0
4208;SE_45;Because while the earth rotates, we see the sun in different direction. The sun rises at the east and sets in the west.;SE.45.556.1;0
4209;SE_45;Because when the earth rotates, not the sun, the sun moves, but it really stays in one place, making the shadow move.;SE.45.558.1;0
4210;SE_45;This is happening because the sun rises in the east so in the morning the shadow will be in the west. The sun sets in the west so the shadows will be in the east.;SE.45.596.1;1
4211;SE_45;The shadow of the bus stop changes direction because the sun is moving throughout the day so the sun will meet different at the stop sign. Because it moves the earth plus the stop sign.;SE.45.599.1;0
4212;SE_45;It is the different time of the day.;SE.45.603.1;0
4213;SE_45;Well Betty the earth moves around the sun and that kind of has something to do with it like at different times shadows move to different directions.;SE.45.606.1;0
4214;SE_45;The bus sign faces different directions because the earth move throughout the day the sun does not move.;SE.45.609.1;0
4215;SE_45;It happens because the earth is rotating and it does not stay on the same place every time of day.;SE.45.611.1;0
4216;SE_45;That happened because the earth moves which made the sun face the other way and made the sign face the other direction.;SE.45.616.1;0
4217;SE_45;Because the sun rises in the east and sets on the west. So in the morning the shadows will be facing one direction and on the afternoon it will be facing the other way.;SE.45.620.1;0
4218;SE_46;Yes. The black box will get hotter than the white because the black box can hold more heat.;SE.46.109.1;0
4219;SE_46;Yes. Because black is a dark color and it absorb heats faster than the white. White reflect so heats up slower.;SE.46.159.1;1
4220;SE_46;Yes. Because black absorbs much more heat of the sun and white reflects the heat of the sun.;SE.46.162.1;1
4221;SE_46;Yes. The black box will collect more heat, because it is black. Black absorbs light from the sun. White reflects light from the light.;SE.46.175.1;1
4222;SE_46;Yes. I pick yes because that black do heat fast than white. Darker color heat faster and more hot air.;SE.46.177.1;0
4223;SE_46;Yes. Because dark colors like black contract heat but light colors like white do not.;SE.46.242.1;0
4224;SE_46;No. Because her data does not have enough information to support her prediction.;SE.46.245.1;0
4225;SE_46;Yes. Because when someone is going to ask her what data support what is she going to say.;SE.46.250.1;0
4226;SE_46;Yes. Because black absorbs heat and white does not absorb heat.;SE.46.251.1;1
4227;SE_46;Black box. Because the black box absorb sunlight and that is why the black box is much more hotter than the white one.;SE.46.254.1;0
4228;SE_46;Yes. Black is hotter than the white box because black gets hotter fast.;SE.46.255.1;0
4229;SE_46;Yes. Because the black one will get hotter than the white one.;SE.46.268.1;0
4230;SE_46;Yes. Yes because black absorbs the heat and traps it, and white just reflects the sun. So her prediction is right.;SE.46.315.1;1
4231;SE_46;Yes. Because black absorbs heat faster than any type of color.;SE.46.317.1;0
4232;SE_46;Yes. Because of the heat like black box is more hotter than the white one because of the color.;SE.46.320.1;0
4233;SE_46;Yes. It will support Amber's prediction because black is covered and it attracts more solar heat.;SE.46.321.1;0
4234;SE_46;Yes. Because black attracts heat. So it will heat up faster.;SE.46.383.1;0
4235;SE_46;Yes. Because the sun hits the boxes and the inside gets really warm. So the thermometer will show the temp.;SE.46.394.1;0
4236;SE_46;Yes. The black absorbs heat and energy, plus, the container is closed so the heat would be trapped inside.;SE.46.399.1;0
4237;SE_46;Yes. Because black heats up faster than white. Because black is a darker and the white is lighter.;SE.46.407.1;0
4238;SE_46;No. The data will not support her answer because all it says are the materials and what she is going to do.;SE.46.416.1;0
4239;SE_46;Yes. Because anything black will absorb the heat, and the heat will make the box hotter every 5 minutes that she checks. But if she was talking about the white box the answer would be no because white does not absorb heat like black does, it just makes it even cooler than hotter. So the answer is Yes!;SE.46.418.1;1
4240;SE_46;Yes. The black box will heat up faster than the white because the black box is darker than the white box so the white box reflects the heat and the black box collects the heat.;SE.46.441.1;1
4241;SE_46;Yes. Yes, because she did all the steps she got 2 boxes and wrapped one with white paper and the other with black paper. She punched a hole in each box, stuck a thermometer into each hole and put the boxes in the sun and recorded the temperature in each box.;SE.46.519.1;0
4242;SE_46;Yes. Yes it will because your prediction is based off of what you know and to have data to refer back to you probably will have a more accurate answer.;SE.46.525.1;0
4243;SE_46;Yes. The black box absorbs the heat, then releases slowly meaning it is hotter because the white box reflects the heat.;SE.46.538.1;1
4244;SE_46;Yes. Well, black attracts to the sun more than white does so the black box is going to get hotter.;SE.46.540.1;0
4245;SE_46;Yes. Because black heats up faster and white reflects.;SE.46.545.1;1
4246;SE_46;Yes. Since the box is black, black attracts or absorbs heat faster, the other box is white which reflects more sunlight than absorbing it.;SE.46.549.1;1
4247;SE_46;Yes. Because the box is black and the heat goes faster than white.;SE.46.570.1;0
4248;SE_46;Yes. If she wanted to heat up a box it would be the black one because a dark color takes the heat faster than the white one because white is brighter than black.;SE.46.580.1;0
4249;SE_46;Yes. The black covered one is going to get hotter because black absorbs heat and white reflects the heat.;SE.46.592.1;1
4250;SE_46;Yes. Yes because light colors will reflect the sun and black or darker colors will absorb the sun and if light or white colors reflect the sun then it will not get as much heat as the black or light colors.;SE.46.593.1;1
4251;SE_46;Yes. Because black always heats faster than white and white reflects the heat from the sun.;SE.46.598.1;1
4252;SE_46;Yes. I know that black materials or plastic or just black will absorb the heat more and white reflects the heat or light back. Also black heats faster and more.;SE.46.599.1;1
4253;SE_46;Yes. I say yes because she will measure each box and she is going to take it cold and hot so one is going to be up and one other is going to go down.;SE.46.600.1;0
4254;SE_48;C. When there are more than one thing it get hotter faster and cooler faster too.;SE.48.104.1;0
4255;SE_48;C. Because there are more black in it.;SE.48.105.1;0
4256;SE_48;C. It got more energy to do.;SE.48.107.1;0
4257;SE_48;C. Because the more the black, the hotter it gets. The less it has, the cooler it gets.;SE.48.117.1;0
4258;SE_48;C. The one with 3 disks could of got hot because it had more disks than A or B. Since it has more disks then it was the one that got the hottest because the sun heat got in it more than the other 2.;SE.48.126.1;1
4259;SE_48;C. C because it holds 3 black papers in the pan with water facing the sun. Black absorbs the heat.;SE.48.136.1;1
4260;SE_48;C. Since more surface area absorbs heat and it was black it makes more sense for it to be more hot.;SE.48.140.1;1
4261;SE_48;C. I selected pan C because pan C got the most black disks so pan C absorbs more heat.;SE.48.173.1;1
4262;SE_48;C. There is more black to attract the sun.;SE.48.247.1;0
4263;SE_48;A. Because B and C will take too long to heat up because there is more water in pan B and C.;SE.48.251.1;0
4264;SE_48;C. Because there are 3 white cakes in pan C.;SE.48.252.1;0
4265;SE_48;C. Because it has more black circles.;SE.48.253.1;0
4266;SE_48;C. It has more black and black heats up fast.;SE.48.257.1;0
4267;SE_48;C. I picked C because it has more pans and they will affect the sun.;SE.48.261.1;0
4268;SE_48;C. Because it has more black in it that attracts the sun to make it hotter.;SE.48.267.1;1
4269;SE_48;C. I pick C because that is the highest of the other.;SE.48.328.1;0
4270;SE_48;C. I think it would be the hottest because it has more black.;SE.48.386.1;1
4271;SE_48;C. Because it has the most plastic disks.;SE.48.387.1;0
4272;SE_48;C. The cake pan C had the most black in it so it warmed up the quickest and made the water warmer.;SE.48.409.1;0
4273;SE_48;C. It has more black disks to absorb more heat.;SE.48.424.1;1
4274;SE_48;C. Pan C had the largest surface area to absorb the heat from the sun, so pan C became the warmest pan in the sun.;SE.48.427.1;1
4275;SE_48;C. Well it has more black, and the sun's heat is attracted by dark colors, so the heat would stay on C.;SE.48.430.1;0
4276;SE_48;C. The black disks absorbs the heat so the width of the disk, the more the heats expands when it touches the water place will be heated up.;SE.48.440.1;1
4277;SE_48;A. Water is a heat sink which slows down the absorption of the heat so the more water the less heat in the pan.;SE.48.441.1;0
4278;SE_48;C. It has more black parts.;SE.48.488.1;0
4279;SE_48;C. Because there are 3 heat sinks on C which will keep the pan warm in the night.;SE.48.490.1;0
4280;SE_48;C. Because the more black it is the more the black is absorbing and making the water the hottest.;SE.48.492.1;0
4281;SE_48;A. Because energy did not have much to heat so it focused on that one thing.;SE.48.493.1;0
4282;SE_48;C. C, because there is more black in C than any other cake pan. The more black the hotter it will get because black absorbs the sun's energy.;SE.48.502.1;0
4283;SE_48;C. They all absorbed the heat. When these disks they absorb and pass the heat between all of them and that is why.;SE.48.507.1;1
4284;SE_48;C. Because the pan has more disks but they also are small so they would heat up easily.;SE.48.513.1;0
4285;SE_48;C. Box C has the most surface area covered so all the plastic circles would absorb energy so it would be the warmest.;SE.48.514.1;1
4286;SE_48;C. It has more black circles.;SE.48.532.1;0
4287;SE_48;A. Because the pancake needed some room and it needs lots of tarp in order for it to have it cooked.;SE.48.548.1;0
4288;SE_48;C. The one with 3 is hotter because more black absorbs more heat.;SE.48.592.1;1
4289;SE_48;C. Pan C has more black disks so the heat will be absorbed because the more black there is the more heat is absorbed.;SE.48.615.1;1

4933;VB_29;You have a standard because if you do not it will not be controlled.;VB.29.381.1;0
4934;VB_29;So that you can see the results of an experiment before a variable is changed so you can compare.;VB.29.384.1;1
4935;VB_29;You use a standard so you will not make a mistake and so you can compare it to differences.;VB.29.388.1;0
4936;VB_29;You start with a standard so you can compare your standard data to your data when you change a variable.;VB.29.394.1;1
4937;VB_29;So you can get the closest answer to the question.;VB.29.397.1;0
4938;VB_29;So you can record and change variables to get a difference.;VB.29.399.1;0
4939;VB_29;So that control your experiment without changing more than one variable.;VB.29.404.1;1
4940;VB_29;To keep the variables controlled.;VB.29.407.1;0
4941;VB_29;You use a standard so you can tell what happened in a controlled experiment and because you can change one variable at a time.;VB.29.416.1;1
4942;VB_29;You would use a standard to change any variables than just one variable that can be changed.;VB.29.419.1;1
4943;VB_29;You use a standard to control your procedure, like if you get it wrong you can see what you did.;VB.29.423.1;0
4944;VB_29;To compare the new experiment with the standard.;VB.29.440.1;0
4945;VB_29;You use a standard because when you change something which is a variable. That when you change it, you know when you did before.;VB.29.444.1;1
4946;VB_29;You use a standard because without a standard, you can change it.;VB.29.448.1;0
4947;VB_29;So you can see what you did after you do the other trials, it makes a controlled experiment to look back on when you change one variable at a time.;VB.29.452.1;0
4948;VB_29;You use a standard to see if you can try a less amount each time you do an experiment.;VB.29.454.1;1
4949;VB_29;You use a standard so that you can test it and compare with your standard. And compare with your variable.;VB.29.458.1;0
4950;VB_29;When conducting a controlled experiment you use a standard because you compare your other results to see if it is accurate.;VB.29.466.1;1
4951;VB_29;You use a standard so you can change the variable if needed in an experiment and you can also change the variable at a time.;VB.29.475.1;0
4952;VB_29;You use a standard because that what you know before the experiment and the standard helps you a lot during the experiment.;VB.29.477.1;0
4953;VB_29;In a controlled experiment you use a standard because when you are testing something else you will have to compare your answers. That is where a standard comes in.;VB.29.481.1;0
4954;VB_29;To compare your answers.;VB.29.486.1;0
4955;VB_29;We use a standard first because we could know how it went then we could use the score it went and test it again.;VB.29.489.1;0
4956;VB_29;You use a standard is to know what you will do and how it will happen.;VB.29.495.1;0
4957;VB_29;So when you change variables you can compare you standard and the other ones.;VB.29.497.1;0
4958;VB_29;So you can test the standard and can switch one variable to make it proven.;VB.29.501.1;0
4959;VB_29;Because you want to know what is the regular way and to compare the first way.;VB.29.503.1;0
4960;VB_29;So you can compare your answers.;VB.29.523.1;0
4961;VB_29;To compare the experiment with the standard one.;VB.29.525.1;0
4962;VB_29;So when you are done you could compare.;VB.29.530.1;0
4963;VB_29;So you compare at the end of the experiment.;VB.29.533.1;0
4964;VB_29;To see if the standard might be faster than the other.;VB.29.537.1;0
4965;VB_29;Because you can compare the results.;VB.29.542.1;0
