0;EM_45b;The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.
1;EM_45c;The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.
2;EM_16b;Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.
3;EM_21a;Rub the minerals together and see which one scratches the other.
4;EM_21b;The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.
5;EM_43b;Put acid on a rock. If the acid fizzes, Phil would know that the rock has calcite.
6;EM_46;The crystals have different shapes. Salt crystals are square with little Xs. The calcite crystals are shaped like needles (long and skinny).
7;EM_48b;The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.
8;EM_26;The salt crystals are squares with Xs on top.
9;EM_27b;Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.
10;EM_35;The harder coin will scratch the other.
11;EM_47;The sand particles are larger and settle first. The flour particles are smaller and therefore settle more slowly.
12;FN_20a;Measure out equal masses of walnuts and peanuts. Smash the samples uniformly in the same size area on brown paper. Wait the same time for each sample.
13;FN_20b;Anna should compare the size of the grease spots. The sample with the larger grease spot has more fat.
14;FN_19b;Susan should compare the amount of gas in each bag. The bag with the most gas contains the food with the most sugar.
15;FN_24b;No, Fruity cream cookies are not pure sugar. The cookies did not produce as much gas as was produced by the pure sugar.
16;FN_24c;Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.
17;FN_17a;The food contains sugar.
18;FN_17c;If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.
19;FN_27a;Overly Orange takes fewer drops to change the color of indophenol so Overly Orange has a higher concentration of vitamin C.
20;FN_27b;Fruitsnap contains little or no vitamin C so Fruitsnap does not change the color of the indophenol.
21;II_13a;Both finger patterns are loops.
22;II_26;Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.
23;II_13b;The loops begin at opposite sides of the print.
24;II_24b;Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.
25;II_20b;Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.
26;II_38;The mirror would complete the image of the object and make the object appear whole.
27;LF_39;2: Trace the features from the photograph onto the overlay grid. 4: Transfer the features to the matching squares on the smaller grid in your notebook.
28;LF_31b;Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).
29;LF_33b;The clay particles are lighter or smaller and are therefore carried farther by the water, so the clay particles end up the greatest distance away from the mouth of the river.
30;LF_34b;Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).
31;LF_18a;During a flood there is more water in the creek and the water flows faster.
32;LF_28a2;You can see how much time is taken for the earth materials to move.
33;LF_26a2;She recommended the topographic map because the map shows the elevations along the trail. Pam would know where the trail was the steepest.
34;LF_26b2;The contour lines are closest together at Q.
35;LF_13a;Earth materials settle out during deposition.
36;LF_27a;40 meters. The change in elevation is 20 meters between A and B and 20 meters between B and C. So the change between A and C is 40 meters. 20 m plus 20 m equals 40 m.
37;LF_6b;A bigger hole puts more water in the stream. Increased flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion. A steeper slope makes the water flow faster. Faster flow moves more earth materials, increasing erosion.
38;LP_15c;If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.
39;LP_16d;You have to pull up in this system.  In the single fixed pulley system, you get a directional advantage.
40;ME_27b;"If the key sticks, the key is iron; if the key does not stick the key is aluminum."
41;ME_28b;Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.
42;ME_30;A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.
43;ME_5b;The brass ring would not stick to the nail because the ring is not iron. The nail is a temporary magnet, but brass cannot become a temporary magnet and thus does not stick to magnets.
44;ME_66a;No, string is an insulator, so the pathway would not be completed.
45;ME_66b;Yes, aluminum foil is a metal and all metals conduct. The aluminum foil would complete the circuit.
46;ME_6b;The circuit is not complete. The electrical pathway is broken.
47;ME_72;That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.
48;ME_7a;Lee should put one of the loose wires on one part of the object and the other loose wire on another part of the object and see if the object completes the circuit.
49;ME_7b;If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.
50;ME_17a;The bulb will light.
51;ME_17b;There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.
52;ME_17c;The motor will run.
53;ME_17d;There is a complete circuit connecting the motor to the D-cell battery.
54;ME_17e;No. Only one circuit can be complete at a time.
55;ME_38a;The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.
56;ME_10;The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.
57;ME_78b;The motor will continue to run because the motor still has a pathway to the D-cell.
58;ME_79;When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.
59;ME_65a;If the middle bulb burns out the other 2 bulbs will stay lit.
60;ME_65b;The circuit is parallel, so each bulb has its own pathway to the D-cell battery, so the bulbs that do not burn out continue to shine.
61;ME_69b;You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.
62;ME_73;Wendy should hook one end of the wire to the negative side of a D-cell battery and the other end to the positive side of the D-cell battery.
63;MS_64a;Greta and Andre have different sized hands.
64;MS_43a;The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.
65;MS_43b;Use a standard unit of mass like grams.
66;MS_39;So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.
67;MS_50a;Bill must have been using degrees Celsius if 28 is a warm temperature.
68;MS_14b;There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.
69;MS_30b;Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.
70;MX_1;The dissolved salt particles are small enough to go through the holes in the filter paper, but the sand particles are too large.
71;MX_22a;A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.
72;MX_24;The solid dissolves (seems to disappear) and the liquid remains clear.
73;MX_52b;Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.
74;MX_42a;The particles of the solid are too big to go through the holes in the paper filter.
75;MX_16a;Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.
76;MX_46b;The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.
77;MX_47b;Both solutions are saturated (as indicated by the material on the bottom) so, even though one cup has more spoonfuls of sugar, both have the same (maximum) concentration.
78;MX_10;Bubbling means a gas has formed. Gas is a new material. A new material indicates a reaction.
79;MX_18;A chemical reaction occurred. [The white solid is a precipitate (a new material) which indicates the reaction.]
80;MX_19;The fizzing indicates a gas, a new material, is produced. When a new material is produced, a chemical reaction has occurred.
81;MX_36a;A solution was created when the eggshells disappeared (dissolved) and the mixture ended up as a clear liquid.
82;MX_36b;A reaction was indicated by the bubbles of gas (a new material) being produced.
83;MX_41;Yes, they could both be correct. Solubility is not the same for all materials.
84;MX_11a;The mixtures are all clear.
85;MX_11c;The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.
86;MX_11e;Set up evaporation dishes. The water will go into the air (evaporate) and the solid will be left in the dish (crystallize).
87;MX_11f;Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.
88;MX_49;X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.
89;MX_53;Crystals of different materials have different shapes. So the shape will help identify the material.
90;PS_2a;The rubber band vibrates.
91;PS_45b;Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.
92;PS_44;If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.
93;PS_12;The water splashed because the fork was vibrating. Vibrations make sounds.
94;PS_51a;When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.
95;PS_51b;When the string was shorter, the pitch was higher.
96;PS_15bp;The saxophone has the longest and fattest tube.
97;PS_26p;Agree. Vibrations are movements. Vibrations produce sound.
98;PS_46b;So that people notice the sound.
99;PS_4ap;When the string is tighter, the pitch will be higher.
100;PS_4bp;When the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.
101;SE_10;Shadows change during the day because the Earth is turning. The Sun stays in one place.
102;SE_24a;In the afternoon, shadows point east because the Sun is in the west. So the west side is opposite of the shadows.
103;SE_3c;The tree blocks the light from the Sun.
104;SE_4a;A heat sink is any material that absorbs (a lot of) heat.
105;SE_16b2;20 centimeters size is between 10 and 30 centimeters, so the temperature change must be less than the 30 centimeters container, but more than the 10 centimeters container. 6 degrees Celsius is halfway between.
106;SE_22a;Water heats up faster when covered.
107;SE_22b;Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.
108;SE_22c;When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.
109;SE_47b;Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.
110;SE_51b;The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.
111;SE_25a;A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.
112;SE_31b;A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.
113;SE_45;In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.
114;SE_46;Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.
115;SE_48;C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.
116;ST_54b2;The cotyledon provides food for the plant to begin growing.
117;ST_54b3;The embryo contains the tiny leaves and root of the plant.
118;ST_58;If a part of the plant contains seeds, that part is the fruit.
119;ST_25b1;The seed coat protects the seed until the plant begins to grow.
120;ST_25b2;The cotyledon provides food for the plant until the plant can make food for itself.
121;ST_52a;The root grows first so the root can take up water for the plant.
122;ST_31b;The elytra are used to make sounds.
123;ST_59;Elena should include a separate shelter for each lizard.
124;VB_1;An experiment is controlled if only one variable is changed at a time.
125;VB_12d;The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.
126;VB_40a;The boat with 0 marbles is the standard in this experiment.
127;VB_5a;As time increases, the number of tree rings also increases.
128;VB_5b;As time increases, the speed of light stays the same (remains constant).
129;VB_22c;When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.
130;VB_42;The more blocks the truck carries, the less distance the truck travels in 10 seconds.
131;VB_15a;The launch position (line on the playground) is the variable that is controlled.
132;VB_15b;Different girls are throwing the balls. The girls use different launch techniques. Each girl uses a different type of ball.
133;VB_15c;All variables except the girl need to be held constant (controlled). The girls all need to throw the same ball and use the same launch technique.
134;VB_29;A standard is used for comparison to determine how changing one variable changes the results.
